the normans ( norman : nourmands ; french : normands ; latin : normanni ) were the people who in the 10th and 11th centuries gave their name to normandy , a region in france . they were descended from norse ( " norman " comes from " norseman " ) raiders and pirates from denmark , iceland and norway who , under their leader rollo , agreed to swear fealty to king charles iii of west francia . through generations of assimilation and mixing with the native frankish and roman - gaulish populations , their descendants would gradually merge with the carolingian - based cultures of west francia . the distinct cultural and ethnic identity of the normans emerged initially in the first half of the 10th century , and it continued to evolve over the succeeding centuries .	110	139

the norman dynasty had a major political , cultural and military impact on medieval europe and even the near east . the normans were famed for their martial spirit and eventually for their christian piety , becoming exponents of the catholic orthodoxy into which they assimilated . they adopted the gallo - romance language of the frankish land they settled , their dialect becoming known as norman , normaund or norman french , an important literary language . the duchy of normandy , which they formed by treaty with the french crown , was a great fief of medieval france , and under richard i of normandy was forged into a cohesive and formidable principality in feudal tenure . the normans are noted both for their culture , such as their unique romanesque architecture and musical traditions , and for their significant military accomplishments and innovations . norman adventurers founded the kingdom of sicily under roger ii after conquering southern italy on the saracens and byzantines , and an expedition on behalf of their duke , william the conqueror , led to the norman conquest of england at the battle of hastings in 1066 . norman cultural and military influence spread from these new european centres to the crusader states of the near east , where their prince bohemond i founded the principality of antioch in the levant , to scotland and wales in great britain , to ireland , and to the coasts of north africa and the canary islands .	78	118
the english name " normans " comes from the french words normans / normanz , plural of normant , modern french normand , which is itself borrowed from old low franconian nortmann " northman " or directly from old norse norðmaðr , latinized variously as nortmannus , normannus , or nordmannus ( recorded in medieval latin , 9th century ) to mean " norseman , viking " .	0	67
the descendants of rollo 's vikings and their frankish wives would replace the norse religion and old norse language with catholicism ( christianity ) and the gallo - romance language of the local people , blending their maternal frankish heritage with old norse traditions and customs to synthesize a unique " norman " culture in the north of france . the norman language was forged by the adoption of the indigenous langue d'oil branch of romance by a norse - speaking ruling class , and it developed into the regional language that survives today .	0	59
the normans thereafter adopted the growing feudal doctrines of the rest of france , and worked them into a functional hierarchical system in both normandy and in england . the new norman rulers were culturally and ethnically distinct from the old french aristocracy , most of whom traced their lineage to franks of the carolingian dynasty . most norman knights remained poor and land - hungry , and by 1066 normandy had been exporting fighting horsemen for more than a generation . many normans of italy , france and england eventually served as avid crusaders under the italo - norman prince bohemund i and the anglo - norman king richard the lion - heart .	57	81
one of the first norman mercenaries to serve as a byzantine general was herve in the 1050s . by then however , there were already norman mercenaries serving as far away as trebizond and georgia . they were based at malatya and edessa , under the byzantine duke of antioch , isaac komnenos . in the 1060s , robert crispin led the normans of edessa against the turks . roussel de bailleul even tried to carve out an independent state in asia minor with support from the local population , but he was stopped by the byzantine general alexius komnenos .	54	68

some normans joined turkish forces to aid in the destruction of the armenians vassal - states of sassoun and taron in far eastern anatolia . later , many took up service with the armenian state further south in cilicia and the taurus mountains . a norman named oursel led a force of " franks " into the upper euphrates valley in northern syria . from 1073 to 1074 , 8 , 000 of the 20 , 000 troops of the armenian general philaretus brachamius were normans — formerly of oursel — led by raimbaud . they even lent their ethnicity to the name of their castle : afranji , meaning " franks . " the known trade between amalfi and antioch and between bari and tarsus may be related to the presence of italo - normans in those cities while amalfi and bari were under norman rule in italy .	44	63
robert guiscard , an other norman adventurer previously elevated to the dignity of count of apulia as the result of his military successes , ultimately drove the byzantines out of southern italy . having obtained the consent of pope gregory vii and acting as his vassal , robert continued his campaign conquering the balkan peninsula as a foothold for western feudal lords and the catholic church . after allying himself with croatia and the catholic cities of dalmatia , in 1081 he led an army of 30 , 000 men in 300 ships landing on the southern shores of albania , capturing valona , kanina , jericho ( orikumi ) , and reaching butrint after numerous pillages . they joined the fleet that had previously conquered corfu and attacked dyrrachium from land and sea , devastating everything along the way . under these harsh circumstances , the locals accepted the call of emperor alexius i comnenus to join forces with the byzantines against the normans . the albanian forces could not take part in the ensuing battle because it had started before their arrival . immediately before the battle , the venetian fleet had secured a victory in the coast surrounding the city . forced to retreat , alexius ceded the command to a high albanian official named comiscortes in the service of byzantium . the city 's garrison resisted until february 1082 , when dyrrachium was betrayed to the normans by the venetian and amalfitan merchants who had settled there . the normans were now free to penetrate into the hinterland ; they took ioannina and some minor cities in southwestern macedonia and thessaly before appearing at the gates of thessalonica . dissension among the high ranks coerced the normans to retreat to italy . they lost dyrrachium , valona , and butrint in 1085 , after the death of robert .	67	117

the further decline of byzantine state - of - affairs paved the road to a third attack in 1185 , when a large norman army invaded dyrrachium , owing to the betrayal of high byzantine officials . some time later , dyrrachium — one of the most important naval bases of the adriatic — fell again to byzantine hands .	37	51
when finally edward the confessor returned from his father 's refuge in 1041 , at the invitation of his half - brother harthacnut , he brought with him a norman - educated mind . he also brought many norman counsellors and fighters , some of whom established an english cavalry force . this concept never really took root , but it is a typical example of the attitudes of edward . he appointed robert of jumieges archbishop of canterbury and made ralph the timid earl of hereford . he invited his brother - in - law eustace ii , count of boulogne to his court in 1051 , an event which resulted in the greatest of early conflicts between saxon and norman and ultimately resulted in the exile of earl godwin of wessex .	0	33
in 1066 , duke william ii of normandy conquered england killing king harold ii at the battle of hastings . the invading normans and their descendants replaced the anglo - saxons as the ruling class of england . the nobility of england were part of a single normans culture and many had lands on both sides of the channel . early norman kings of england , as dukes of normandy , owed homage to the king of france for their land on the continent . they considered england to be their most important holding ( it brought with it the title of king — an important status symbol ) .	20	37

one of the claimants of the english throne opposing william the conqueror , edgar atheling , eventually fled to scotland . king malcolm iii of scotland married edgar 's sister margaret , and came into opposition to william who had already disputed scotland 's southern borders . william invaded scotland in 1072 , riding as far as abernethy where he met up with his fleet of ships . malcolm submitted , paid homage to william and surrendered his son duncan as a hostage , beginning a series of arguments as to whether the scottish crown owed allegiance to the king of england .	68	102
normans came into scotland , building castles and founding noble families who would provide some future kings , such as robert the bruce , as well as founding a considerable number of the scottish clans . king david i of scotland , whose elder brother alexander i had married sybilla of normandy , was instrumental in introducing normans and norman culture to scotland , part of the process some scholars call the " davidian revolution " . having spent time at the court of henry i of england ( married to david 's sister maud of scotland ) , and needing them to wrestle the kingdom from his half - brother mael coluim mac alaxandair , david had to reward many with lands . the process was continued under david 's successors , most intensely of all under william the lion . the norman - derived feudal system was applied in varying degrees to most of scotland . scottish families of the names bruce , gray , ramsay , fraser , ogilvie , montgomery , sinclair , pollock , burnard , douglas and gordon to name but a few , and including the later royal house of stewart , can all be traced back to norman ancestry .	36	76
in 1096 , crusaders passing by the siege of amalfi were joined by bohemond of taranto and his nephew tancred with an army of italo - normans . bohemond was the de facto leader of the crusade during its passage through asia minor . after the successful siege of antioch in 1097 , bohemond began carving out an independent principality around that city . tancred was instrumental in the conquest of jerusalem and he worked for the expansion of the crusader kingdom in transjordan and the region of galilee .

in april 1191 richard the lion - hearted left messina with a large fleet in order to reach acre . but a storm dispersed the fleet . after some searching , it was discovered that the boat carrying his sister and his fiancee berengaria was anchored on the south coast of cyprus , together with the wrecks of several other ships , including the treasure ship . survivors of the wrecks had been taken prisoner by the island 's despot isaac komnenos . on 1 may 1191 , richard 's fleet arrived in the port of limassol on cyprus . he ordered isaac to release the prisoners and the treasure . isaac refused , so richard landed his troops and took limassol .	67	82
bethencourt took the title of king of the canary islands , as vassal to henry iii of castile . in 1418 , jean 's nephew maciot de bethencourt sold the rights to the islands to enrique perez de guzman , 2nd count de niebla .	19	44
in england , the period of norman architecture immediately succeeds that of the anglo - saxon and precedes the early gothic . in southern italy , the normans incorporated elements of islamic , lombard , and byzantine building techniques into their own , initiating a unique style known as norman - arab architecture within the kingdom of sicily .	0	21
by far the most famous work of norman art is the bayeux tapestry , which is not a tapestry but a work of embroidery . it was commissioned by odo , the bishop of bayeux and first earl of kent , employing natives from kent who were learned in the nordic traditions imported in the previous half century by the danish vikings .	0	24

in britain , norman art primarily survives as stonework or metalwork , such as capitals and baptismal fonts . in southern italy , however , norman artwork survives plentifully in forms strongly influenced by its greek , lombard , and arab forebears . of the royal regalia preserved in palermo , the crown is byzantine in style and the coronation cloak is of arab craftsmanship with arabic inscriptions . many churches preserve sculptured fonts , capitals , and more importantly mosaics , which were common in norman italy and drew heavily on the greek heritage . lombard salerno was a centre of ivorywork in the 11th century and this continued under norman domination . finally should be noted the intercourse between french crusaders traveling to the holy land who brought with them french artefacts with which to gift the churches at which they stopped in southern italy amongst their norman cousins . for this reason many south italian churches preserve works from france alongside their native pieces .	69	95
computational complexity theory is a branch of the theory of computation in theoretical computer science that focuses on classifying computational problems according to their inherent difficulty , and relating those classes to each other . a computational problem is understood to be a task that is in principle amenable to being solved by a computer , which is equivalent to stating that the problem may be solved by mechanical application of mathematical steps , such as an algorithm .	35	78

closely related fields in theoretical computer science are analysis of algorithms and computability theory . a key distinction between analysis of algorithms and computational complexity theory is that the former is devoted to analyzing the amount of resources needed by a particular algorithm to solve a problem , whereas the latter asks a more general question about all possible algorithms that could be used to solve the same problem . more precisely , it tries to classify problems that can or can not be solved with appropriately restricted resources . in turn , imposing restrictions on the available resources is what distinguishes computational complexity from computability theory : the latter theory asks what kind of problems can , in principle , be solved algorithmically .	15	69

to further highlight the difference between a problem and an instance , consider the following instance of the decision version of the traveling salesman problem : is there a route of at most 2000 kilometres passing through all of germany 's 15 largest cities ? the quantitative answer to this particular problem instance is of little use for solving other instances of the problem , such as asking for a round trip through all sites in milan whose total length is at most 10 km . for this reason , complexity theory addresses computational problems and not particular problem instances .	86	100

when considering computational problems , a problem instance is a string over an alphabet . usually , the alphabet is taken to be the binary alphabet ( i . e . , the set { 0 , 1 } ) , and thus the strings are bitstrings . as in a real - world computer , mathematical objects other than bitstrings must be suitably encoded . for example , integers can be represented in binary notation , and graphs can be encoded directly via their adjacency matrices , or by encoding their adjacency lists in binary .	15	47

an example of a decision problem is the following . the input is an arbitrary graph . the problem consists in deciding whether the given graph is connected , or not . the formal language associated with this decision problem is then the set of all connected graphs — of course , to obtain a precise definition of this language , one has to decide how graphs are encoded as binary strings .	32	72

if the input size is n , the time taken can be expressed as a function of n . since the time taken on different inputs of the same size can be different , the worst - case time complexity t ( n ) is defined to be the maximum time taken over all inputs of size n . if t ( n ) is a polynomial in n , then the algorithm is said to be a polynomial time algorithm . cobham 's thesis says that a problem can be solved with a feasible amount of resources if it admits a polynomial time algorithm .	19	58

a turing machine is a mathematical model of a general computing machine . it is a theoretical device that manipulates symbols contained on a strip of tape . turing machines are not intended as a practical computing technology , but rather as a thought experiment representing a computing machine — anything from an advanced supercomputer to a mathematician with a pencil and paper . it is believed that if a problem can be solved by an algorithm , there exists a turing machine that solves the problem . indeed , this is the statement of the church – turing thesis . furthermore , it is known that everything that can be computed on other models of computation known to us today , such as a ram machine , conway 's game of life , cellular automata or any programming language can be computed on a turing machine . since turing machines are easy to analyze mathematically , and are believed to be as powerful as any other model of computation , the turing machine is the most commonly used model in complexity theory .	0	12

many types of turing machines are used to define complexity classes , such as deterministic turing machines , probabilistic turing machines , non - deterministic turing machines , quantum turing machines , symmetric turing machines and alternating turing machines . they are all equally powerful in principle , but when resources ( such as time or space ) are bounded , some of these may be more powerful than others .	40	70
many machine models different from the standard multi - tape turing machines have been proposed in the literature , for example random access machines . perhaps surprisingly , each of these models can be converted to another without providing any extra computational power . the time and memory consumption of these alternate models may vary . what all these models have in common is that the machines operate deterministically .	44	55

however , some computational problems are easier to analyze in terms of more unusual resources . for example , a non - deterministic turing machine is a computational model that is allowed to branch out to check many different possibilities at once . the non - deterministic turing machine has very little to do with how we physically want to compute algorithms , but its branching exactly captures many of the mathematical models we want to analyze , so that non - deterministic time is a very important resource in analyzing computational problems .	43	93
for a precise definition of what it means to solve a problem using a given amount of time and space , a computational model such as the deterministic turing machine is used . the time required by a deterministic turing machine m on input x is the total number of state transitions , or steps , the machine makes before it halts and outputs the answer ( " yes " or " no " ) . a turing machine m is said to operate within time f ( n ) , if the time required by m on each input of length n is at most f ( n ) . a decision problem a can be solved in time f ( n ) if there exists a turing machine operating in time f ( n ) that solves the problem . since complexity theory is interested in classifying problems based on their difficulty , one defines sets of problems based on some criteria . for instance , the set of problems solvable within time f ( n ) on a deterministic turing machine is then denoted by dtime ( f ( n ) ) .	165	195
analogous definitions can be made for space requirements . although time and space are the most well - known complexity resources , any complexity measure can be viewed as a computational resource . complexity measures are very generally defined by the blum complexity axioms . other complexity measures used in complexity theory include communication complexity , circuit complexity , and decision tree complexity .	45	63
the best , worst and average case complexity refer to three different ways of measuring the time complexity ( or any other complexity measure ) of different inputs of the same size . since some inputs of size n may be faster to solve than others , we define the following complexities :	0	32

for example , consider the deterministic sorting algorithm quicksort . this solves the problem of sorting a list of integers that is given as the input . the worst - case is when the input is sorted or sorted in reverse order , and the algorithm takes time o ( n2 ) for this case . if we assume that all possible permutations of the input list are equally likely , the average time taken for sorting is o ( n log n ) . the best case occurs when each pivoting divides the list in half , also needing o ( n log n ) time .	0	9

upper and lower bounds are usually stated using the big o notation , which hides constant factors and smaller terms . this makes the bounds independent of the specific details of the computational model used . for instance , if t ( n ) = 7n2 + 15n + 40 , in big o notation one would write t ( n ) = o ( n2 ) .	0	20

but bounding the computation time above by some concrete function f ( n ) often yields complexity classes that depend on the chosen machine model . for instance , the language { xx | x is any binary string } can be solved in linear time on a multi - tape turing machine , but necessarily requires quadratic time in the model of single - tape turing machines . if we allow polynomial variations in running time , cobham - edmonds thesis states that " the time complexities in any two reasonable and general models of computation are polynomially related " ( goldreich 2008 , chapter 1 . 2 ) . this forms the basis for the complexity class p , which is the set of decision problems solvable by a deterministic turing machine within polynomial time . the corresponding set of function problems is fp .	69	110

the time and space hierarchy theorems form the basis for most separation results of complexity classes . for instance , the time hierarchy theorem tells us that p is strictly contained in exptime , and the space hierarchy theorem tells us that l is strictly contained in pspace .	0	16
the most commonly used reduction is a polynomial - time reduction . this means that the reduction process takes polynomial time . for example , the problem of squaring an integer can be reduced to the problem of multiplying two integers . this means an algorithm for multiplying two integers can be used to square an integer . indeed , this can be done by giving the same input to both inputs of the multiplication algorithm . thus we see that squaring is not more difficult than multiplication , since squaring can be reduced to multiplication .	0	11

this motivates the concept of a problem being hard for a complexity class . a problem x is hard for a class of problems c if every problem in c can be reduced to x . thus no problem in c is harder than x , since an algorithm for x allows us to solve any problem in c . of course , the notion of hard problems depends on the type of reduction being used . for complexity classes larger than p , polynomial - time reductions are commonly used . in particular , the set of problems that are hard for np is the set of np - hard problems .	14	35

if a problem x is in c and hard for c , then x is said to be complete for c . this means that x is the hardest problem in c . ( since many problems could be equally hard , one might say that x is one of the hardest problems in c . ) thus the class of np - complete problems contains the most difficult problems in np , in the sense that they are the ones most likely not to be in p . because the problem p = np is not solved , being able to reduce a known np - complete problem , π2 , to another problem , π1 , would indicate that there is no known polynomial - time solution for π1 . this is because a polynomial - time solution to π1 would yield a polynomial - time solution to π2 . similarly , because all np problems can be reduced to the set , finding an np - complete problem that can be solved in polynomial time would mean that p = np .	57	88

problems that can be solved in theory ( e . g . , given large but finite time ) , but which in practice take too long for their solutions to be useful , are known as intractable problems . in complexity theory , problems that lack polynomial - time solutions are considered to be intractable for more than the smallest inputs . in fact , the cobham – edmonds thesis states that only those problems that can be solved in polynomial time can be feasibly computed on some computational device . problems that are known to be intractable in this sense include those that are exptime - hard . if np is not the same as p , then the np - complete problems are also intractable in this sense . to see why exponential - time algorithms might be unusable in practice , consider a program that makes 2n operations before halting . for small n , say 100 , and assuming for the sake of example that the computer does 1012 operations each second , the program would run for about 4 × 1010 years , which is the same order of magnitude as the age of the universe . even with a much faster computer , the program would only be useful for very small instances and in that sense the intractability of a problem is somewhat independent of technological progress . nevertheless , a polynomial time algorithm is not always practical . if its running time is , say , n15 , it is unreasonable to consider it efficient and it is still useless except on small instances .	0	39
what intractability means in practice is open to debate . saying that a problem is not in p does not imply that all large cases of the problem are hard or even that most of them are . for example , the decision problem in presburger arithmetic has been shown not to be in p , yet algorithms have been written that solve the problem in reasonable times in most cases . similarly , algorithms can solve the np - complete knapsack problem over a wide range of sizes in less than quadratic time and sat solvers routinely handle large instances of the np - complete boolean satisfiability problem .	38	71

a term used originally in derision , huguenot has unclear origins . various hypotheses have been promoted . the nickname may have been a combined reference to the swiss politician besancon hugues ( died 1532 ) and the religiously conflicted nature of swiss republicanism in his time , using a clever derogatory pun on the name hugues by way of the dutch word huisgenoten ( literally housemates ) , referring to the connotations of a somewhat related word in german eidgenosse ( confederates as in " a citizen of one of the states of the swiss confederacy " ) . geneva was john calvin 's adopted home and the centre of the calvinist movement . in geneva , hugues , though catholic , was a leader of the " confederate party " , so called because it favoured independence from the duke of savoy through an alliance between the city - state of geneva and the swiss confederation . the label huguenot was purportedly first applied in france to those conspirators ( all of them aristocratic members of the reformed church ) involved in the amboise plot of 1560 : a foiled attempt to wrest power in france from the influential house of guise . the move would have had the side effect of fostering relations with the swiss . thus , hugues plus eidgenosse by way of huisgenoten supposedly became huguenot , a nickname associating the protestant cause with politics unpopular in france .

the availability of the bible in vernacular languages was important to the spread of the protestant movement and development of the reformed church in france . the country had a long history of struggles with the papacy by the time the protestant reformation finally arrived . around 1294 , a french version of the scriptures was prepared by the roman catholic priest , guyard de moulin . a two - volume illustrated folio paraphrase version based on his manuscript , by jean de rely , was printed in paris in 1487 .	46	66

in the early years , many huguenots also settled in the area of present - day charleston , south carolina . in 1685 , rev . elie prioleau from the town of pons in france , was among the first to settle there . he became pastor of the first huguenot church in north america in that city . after the revocation of the edict of nantes in 1685 , several huguenot families of norman and carolingian nobility and descent , including edmund bohun of suffolk england from the humphrey de bohun line of french royalty descended from charlemagne , jean postell of dieppe france , alexander pepin , antoine poitevin of orsement france , and jacques de bordeaux of grenoble , immigrated to the charleston orange district . they were very successful at marriage and property speculation . after petitioning the british crown in 1697 for the right to own land in the baronies , they prospered as slave owners on the cooper , ashepoo , ashley and santee river plantations they purchased from the british landgrave edmund bellinger . some of their descendants moved into the deep south and texas , where they developed new plantations .	21	43

stadtholder william iii of orange , who later became king of england , emerged as the strongest opponent of king louis xiv after the french attacked the dutch republic in 1672 . william formed the league of augsburg as a coalition to oppose louis and the french state . consequently , many huguenots considered the wealthy and calvinist dutch republic , which led the opposition to louis xiv , as the most attractive country for exile after the revocation of the edict of nantes . they also found many french - speaking calvinist churches there .	0	31
renewed religious warfare in the 1620s caused the political and military privileges of the huguenots to be abolished following their defeat . they retained the religious provisions of the edict of nantes until the rule of louis xiv , who progressively increased persecution of them until he issued the edict of fontainebleau ( 1685 ) , which abolished all legal recognition of protestantism in france , and forced the huguenots to convert . while nearly three - quarters eventually were killed or submitted , roughly 500 , 000 huguenots had fled france by the early 18th century [ citation needed ] .	22	72

huguenot immigrants did not disperse or settle in different parts of the country , but rather , formed three societies or congregations ; one in the city of new york , another 21 miles north of new york in a town which they named new rochelle , and a third further upstate in new paltz . the " huguenot street historic district " in new paltz has been designated a national historic landmark site and contains the oldest street in the united states of america . a small group of huguenots also settled on the south shore of staten island along the new york harbor , for which the current neighborhood of huguenot was named .	0	55
after the revocation of the edict of nantes , the dutch republic received the largest group of huguenot refugees , an estimated total of 75 , 000 to 100 , 000 people . amongst them were 200 clergy . many came from the region of the cevennes , for instance , the village of fraissinet - de - lozere . this was a huge influx as the entire population of the dutch republic amounted to ca . 2 million at that time . around 1700 , it is estimated that nearly 25 % of the amsterdam population was huguenot . [ citation needed ] in 1705 , amsterdam and the area of west frisia were the first areas to provide full citizens rights to huguenot immigrants , followed by the dutch republic in 1715 . huguenots intermarried with dutch from the outset .	0	32
other evidence of the walloons and huguenots in canterbury includes a block of houses in turnagain lane , where weavers ' windows survive on the top floor , as many huguenots worked as weavers . the weavers , a half - timbered house by the river , was the site of a weaving school from the late 16th century to about 1830 . ( it has been adapted as a restaurant — see illustration above . the house derives its name from a weaving school which was moved there in the last years of the 19th century , reviving an earlier use . ) others refugees practised the variety of occupations necessary to sustain the community as distinct from the indigenous population . such economic separation was the condition of the refugees ' initial acceptance in the city . they also settled elsewhere in kent , particularly sandwich , faversham and maidstone — towns in which there used to be refugee churches .	0	34
a number of huguenots served as mayors in dublin , cork , youghal and waterford in the 17th and 18th centuries . numerous signs of huguenot presence can still be seen with names still in use , and with areas of the main towns and cities named after the people who settled there . examples include the huguenot district and french church street in cork city ; and d'olier street in dublin , named after a high sheriff and one of the founders of the bank of ireland . a french church in portarlington dates back to 1696 , and was built to serve the significant new huguenot community in the town . at the time , they constituted the majority of the townspeople .	89	112
the exodus of huguenots from france created a brain drain , as many huguenots had occupied important places in society . the kingdom did not fully recover for years . the french crown 's refusal to allow non - catholics to settle in new france may help to explain that colony 's slow rate of population growth compared to that of the neighbouring british colonies , which opened settlement to religious dissenters . by the time of the french and indian war ( the north american front of the seven years ' war ) , a sizeable population of huguenot descent lived in the british colonies , and many participated in the british defeat of new france in 1759 - 60 .	30	72
the pattern of warfare , followed by brief periods of peace , continued for nearly another quarter - century . the warfare was definitively quelled in 1598 , when henry of navarre , having succeeded to the french throne as henry iv , and having recanted protestantism in favour of roman catholicism , issued the edict of nantes . the edict reaffirmed catholicism as the state religion of france , but granted the protestants equality with catholics under the throne and a degree of religious and political freedom within their domains . the edict simultaneously protected catholic interests by discouraging the founding of new protestant churches in catholic - controlled regions .

the revocation forbade protestant services , required education of children as catholics , and prohibited emigration . it proved disastrous to the huguenots and costly for france . it precipitated civil bloodshed , ruined commerce , and resulted in the illegal flight from the country of hundreds of thousands of protestants , many of whom became intellectuals , doctors and business leaders in britain as well as holland , prussia , and south africa . four thousand emigrated to the north american colonies , where they settled in new york and virginia , especially . the english welcomed the french refugees , providing money from both government and private agencies to aid their relocation . those huguenots who stayed in france became catholics and were called " new converts " .	75	94
the first huguenots to leave france sought freedom from persecution in switzerland and the netherlands . [ citation needed ] a group of huguenots was part of the french colonisers who arrived in brazil in 1555 to found france antarctique . a couple of ships with around 500 people arrived at the guanabara bay , present - day rio de janeiro , and settled in a small island . a fort , named fort coligny , was built to protect them from attack from the portuguese troops and brazilian native americans . it was an attempt to establish a french colony in south america . the fort was destroyed in 1560 by the portuguese , who captured part of the huguenots . the portuguese threatened the prisoners with death if they did not convert to catholicism . the huguenots of guanabara , as they are now known , produced a declaration of faith to express their beliefs to the portuguese . this was their death sentence . this document , the guanabara confession of faith , became the first protestant confession of faith in the whole of the americas .

some huguenots settled in bedfordshire , one of the main centres of the british lace industry at the time . although 19th century sources have asserted that some of these refugees were lacemakers and contributed to the east midlands lace industry , this is contentious . the only reference to immigrant lacemakers in this period is of twenty - five widows who settled in dover , and there is no contemporary documentation to support there being huguenot lacemakers in bedfordshire . the implication that the style of lace known as ' bucks point ' demonstrates a huguenot influence , being a " combination of mechlin patterns on lille ground " , is fallacious : what is now known as mechlin lace did not develop until first half of the eighteenth century and lace with mechlin patterns and lille ground did not appear until the end of the 18th century , when it was widely copied throughout europe .	81	157
in berlin , the huguenots created two new neighbourhoods : dorotheenstadt and friedrichstadt . by 1700 , one - fifth of the city 's population was french speaking . the berlin huguenots preserved the french language in their church services for nearly a century . they ultimately decided to switch to german in protest against the occupation of prussia by napoleon in 1806 - 07 . many of their descendents rose to positions of prominence . several congregations were founded , such as those of fredericia ( denmark ) , berlin , stockholm , hamburg , frankfurt , helsinki , and emden .	14	28
french huguenots made two attempts to establish a haven in north america . in 1562 , naval officer jean ribault led an expedition that explored florida and the present - day southeastern u . s . , and founded the outpost of charlesfort on parris island , south carolina . the wars of religion precluded a return voyage , and the outpost was abandoned . in 1564 , ribault 's former lieutenant rene goulaine de laudonniere launched a second voyage to build a colony ; he established fort caroline in what is now jacksonville , florida . war at home again precluded a resupply mission , and the colony struggled . in 1565 the spanish decided to enforce their claim to la florida , and sent pedro menendez de aviles , who established the settlement of st . augustine near fort caroline . menendez ' forces routed the french and executed most of the protestant captives .	13	49
in 1700 several hundred french huguenots migrated from england to the colony of virginia , where the english crown had promised them land grants in lower norfolk county . when they arrived , colonial authorities offered them instead land 20 miles above the falls of the james river , at the abandoned monacan village known as manakin town , now in powhatan county . some settlers landed in present - day chesterfield county . on 12 may 1705 , the virginia general assembly passed an act to naturalise the 148 huguenots still resident at manakintown . of the original 390 settlers in the isolated settlement , many had died ; others lived outside town on farms in the english style ; and others moved to different areas . gradually they intermarried with their english neighbors . through the 18th and 19th centuries , descendants of the french migrated west into the piedmont , and across the appalachian mountains into the west of what became kentucky , tennessee , missouri , and other states . in the manakintown area , the huguenot memorial bridge across the james river and huguenot road were named in their honor , as were many local features , including several schools , including huguenot high school .	96	127
both before and after the 1708 passage of the foreign protestants naturalization act , an estimated 50 , 000 protestant walloons and huguenots fled to england , with many moving on to ireland and elsewhere . in relative terms , this was one of the largest waves of immigration ever of a single ethnic community to britain . andrew lortie ( born andre lortie ) , a leading huguenot theologian and writer who led the exiled community in london , became known for articulating their criticism of the pope and the doctrine of transubstantiation during mass .	0	35

some disagree with such double or triple non - french linguistic origins , arguing that for the word to have spread into common use in france , it must have originated in the french language . the " hugues hypothesis " argues that the name was derived by association with hugues capet , king of france , who reigned long before the reformation . he was regarded by the gallicans and protestants as a noble man who respected people 's dignity and lives . janet gray and other supporters of the hypothesis suggest that the name huguenote would be roughly equivalent to little hugos , or those who want hugo .	36	63
other predecessors of the reformed church included the pro - reform and gallican roman catholics , such as jacques lefevre ( c . 1455 – 1536 ) . the gallicans briefly achieved independence for the french church , on the principle that the religion of france could not be controlled by the bishop of rome , a foreign power . during the protestant reformation , lefevre , a professor at the university of paris , published his french translation of the new testament in 1523 , followed by the whole bible in the french language in 1530 . william farel was a student of lefevre who went on to become a leader of the swiss reformation , establishing a protestant government in geneva . jean cauvin ( john calvin ) , another student at the university of paris , also converted to protestantism . long after the sect was suppressed by francis i , the remaining french waldensians , then mostly in the luberon region , sought to join william farel , calvin and the reformation , and olivetan published a french bible for them . the french confession of 1559 shows a decidedly calvinistic influence . sometime between 1550 and 1580 , members of the reformed church in france came to be commonly known as huguenots .

one of the most prominent huguenot refugees in the netherlands was pierre bayle . he started teaching in rotterdam , where he finished writing and publishing his multi - volume masterpiece , historical and critical dictionary . it became one of the 100 foundational texts of the us library of congress . some huguenot descendants in the netherlands may be noted by french family names , although they typically use dutch given names . due to the huguenots ' early ties with the leadership of the dutch revolt and their own participation , some of the dutch patriciate are of part - huguenot descent . some huguenot families have kept alive various traditions , such as the celebration and feast of their patron saint nicolas , similar to the dutch sint nicolaas ( sinterklaas ) feast .	105	136

it is a logical extension of the compound engine ( described above ) to split the expansion into yet more stages to increase efficiency . the result is the multiple expansion engine . such engines use either three or four expansion stages and are known as triple and quadruple expansion engines respectively . these engines use a series of cylinders of progressively increasing diameter . these cylinders are designed to divide the work into equal shares for each expansion stage . as with the double expansion engine , if space is at a premium , then two smaller cylinders may be used for the low - pressure stage . multiple expansion engines typically had the cylinders arranged inline , but various other formations were used . in the late 19th century , the yarrow - schlick - tweedy balancing ' system ' was used on some marine triple expansion engines . y - s - t engines divided the low - pressure expansion stages between two cylinders , one at each end of the engine . this allowed the crankshaft to be better balanced , resulting in a smoother , faster - responding engine which ran with less vibration . this made the 4 - cylinder triple - expansion engine popular with large passenger liners ( such as the olympic class ) , but this was ultimately replaced by the virtually vibration - free turbine engine .

in the 1840s and 50s , there were attempts to overcome this problem by means of various patent valve gears with a separate , variable cutoff expansion valve riding on the back of the main slide valve ; the latter usually had fixed or limited cutoff . the combined setup gave a fair approximation of the ideal events , at the expense of increased friction and wear , and the mechanism tended to be complicated . the usual compromise solution has been to provide lap by lengthening rubbing surfaces of the valve in such a way as to overlap the port on the admission side , with the effect that the exhaust side remains open for a longer period after cut - off on the admission side has occurred . this expedient has since been generally considered satisfactory for most purposes and makes possible the use of the simpler stephenson , joy and walschaerts motions . corliss , and later , poppet valve gears had separate admission and exhaust valves driven by trip mechanisms or cams profiled so as to give ideal events ; most of these gears never succeeded outside of the stationary marketplace due to various other issues including leakage and more delicate mechanisms .	76	129

uniflow engines attempt to remedy the difficulties arising from the usual counterflow cycle where , during each stroke , the port and the cylinder walls will be cooled by the passing exhaust steam , whilst the hotter incoming admission steam will waste some of its energy in restoring working temperature . the aim of the uniflow is to remedy this defect and improve efficiency by providing an additional port uncovered by the piston at the end of each stroke making the steam flow only in one direction . by this means , the simple - expansion uniflow engine gives efficiency equivalent to that of classic compound systems with the added advantage of superior part - load performance , and comparable efficiency to turbines for smaller engines below one thousand horsepower . however , the thermal expansion gradient uniflow engines produce along the cylinder wall gives practical difficulties .

the efficiency of a rankine cycle is usually limited by the working fluid . without the pressure reaching supercritical levels for the working fluid , the temperature range the cycle can operate over is quite small ; in steam turbines , turbine entry temperatures are typically 565 ° c ( the creep limit of stainless steel ) and condenser temperatures are around 30 ° c . this gives a theoretical carnot efficiency of about 63 % compared with an actual efficiency of 42 % for a modern coal - fired power station . this low turbine entry temperature ( compared with a gas turbine ) is why the rankine cycle is often used as a bottoming cycle in combined - cycle gas turbine power stations .

a method to lessen the magnitude of this heating and cooling was invented in 1804 by british engineer arthur woolf , who patented his woolf high - pressure compound engine in 1805 . in the compound engine , high - pressure steam from the boiler expands in a high - pressure ( hp ) cylinder and then enters one or more subsequent lower - pressure ( lp ) cylinders . the complete expansion of the steam now occurs across multiple cylinders and as less expansion now occurs in each cylinder less heat is lost by the steam in each . this reduces the magnitude of cylinder heating and cooling , increasing the efficiency of the engine . by staging the expansion in multiple cylinders , torque variability can be reduced . to derive equal work from lower - pressure steam requires a larger cylinder volume as this steam occupies a greater volume . therefore , the bore , and often the stroke , are increased in low - pressure cylinders resulting in larger cylinders .	0	32

where chp is not used , steam turbines in power stations use surface condensers as a cold sink . the condensers are cooled by water flow from oceans , rivers , lakes , and often by cooling towers which evaporate water to provide cooling energy removal . the resulting condensed hot water output from the condenser is then put back into the boiler via a pump . a dry type cooling tower is similar to an automobile radiator and is used in locations where water is costly . evaporative ( wet ) cooling towers use the rejected heat to evaporate water ; this water is kept separate from the condensate , which circulates in a closed system and returns to the boiler . such towers often have visible plumes due to the evaporated water condensing into droplets carried up by the warm air . evaporative cooling towers need less water flow than " once - through " cooling by river or lake water ; a 700 megawatt coal - fired power plant may use about 3600 cubic metres of make - up water every hour for evaporative cooling , but would need about twenty times as much if cooled by river water .

the centrifugal governor was adopted by james watt for use on a steam engine in 1788 after watt ’ s partner boulton saw one at a flour mill boulton & watt were building . the governor could not actually hold a set speed , because it would assume a new constant speed in response to load changes . the governor was able to handle smaller variations such as those caused by fluctuating heat load to the boiler . also , there was a tendency for oscillation whenever there was a speed change . as a consequence , engines equipped only with this governor were not suitable for operations requiring constant speed , such as cotton spinning . the governor was improved over time and coupled with variable steam cut off , good speed control in response to changes in load was attainable near the end of the 19th century .	34	57

the simplest valve gears give events of fixed length during the engine cycle and often make the engine rotate in only one direction . most however have a reversing mechanism which additionally can provide means for saving steam as speed and momentum are gained by gradually " shortening the cutoff " or rather , shortening the admission event ; this in turn proportionately lengthens the expansion period . however , as one and the same valve usually controls both steam flows , a short cutoff at admission adversely affects the exhaust and compression periods which should ideally always be kept fairly constant ; if the exhaust event is too brief , the totality of the exhaust steam can not evacuate the cylinder , choking it and giving excessive compression ( " kick back " ) .

a steam turbine consists of one or more rotors ( rotating discs ) mounted on a drive shaft , alternating with a series of stators ( static discs ) fixed to the turbine casing . the rotors have a propeller - like arrangement of blades at the outer edge . steam acts upon these blades , producing rotary motion . the stator consists of a similar , but fixed , series of blades that serve to redirect the steam flow onto the next rotor stage . a steam turbine often exhausts into a surface condenser that provides a vacuum . the stages of a steam turbine are typically arranged to extract the maximum potential work from a specific velocity and pressure of steam , giving rise to a series of variably sized high - and low - pressure stages . turbines are only efficient if they rotate at relatively high speed , therefore they are usually connected to reduction gearing to drive lower speed applications , such as a ship 's propeller . in the vast majority of large electric generating stations , turbines are directly connected to generators with no reduction gearing . typical speeds are 3600 revolutions per minute ( rpm ) in the usa with 60 hertz power , 3000 rpm in europe and other countries with 50 hertz electric power systems . in nuclear power applications the turbines typically run at half these speeds , 1800 rpm and 1500 rpm . a turbine rotor is also only capable of providing power when rotating in one direction . therefore , a reversing stage or gearbox is usually required where power is required in the opposite direction .

steam engines frequently possess two independent mechanisms for ensuring that the pressure in the boiler does not go too high ; one may be adjusted by the user , the second is typically designed as an ultimate fail - safe . such safety valves traditionally used a simple lever to restrain a plug valve in the top of a boiler . one end of the lever carried a weight or spring that restrained the valve against steam pressure . early valves could be adjusted by engine drivers , leading to many accidents when a driver fastened the valve down to allow greater steam pressure and more power from the engine . the more recent type of safety valve uses an adjustable spring - loaded valve , which is locked such that operators may not tamper with its adjustment unless a seal illegally is broken . this arrangement is considerably safer .

the acme of the horizontal engine was the corliss steam engine , patented in 1849 , which was a four - valve counter flow engine with separate steam admission and exhaust valves and automatic variable steam cutoff . when corliss was given the rumford medal the committee said that " no one invention since watt 's time has so enhanced the efficiency of the steam engine " . in addition to using 30 % less steam , it provided more uniform speed due to variable steam cut off , making it well suited to manufacturing , especially cotton spinning .	0	37

the steam engine contributed much to the development of thermodynamic theory ; however , the only applications of scientific theory that influenced the steam engine were the original concepts of harnessing the power of steam and atmospheric pressure and knowledge of properties of heat and steam . the experimental measurements made by watt on a model steam engine led to the development of the separate condenser . watt independently discovered latent heat , which was confirmed by the original discoverer joseph black , who also advised watt on experimental procedures . watt was also aware of the change in the boiling point of water with pressure . otherwise , the improvements to the engine itself were more mechanical in nature . the thermodynamic concepts of the rankine cycle did give engineers the understanding needed to calculate efficiency which aided the development of modern high - pressure and - temperature boilers and the steam turbine .	67	90

one of the principal advantages the rankine cycle holds over others is that during the compression stage relatively little work is required to drive the pump , the working fluid being in its liquid phase at this point . by condensing the fluid , the work required by the pump consumes only 1 % to 3 % of the turbine power and contributes to a much higher efficiency for a real cycle . the benefit of this is lost somewhat due to the lower heat addition temperature . gas turbines , for instance , have turbine entry temperatures approaching 1500 ° c . nonetheless , the efficiencies of actual large steam cycles and large modern gas turbines are fairly well matched .

the rankine cycle is sometimes referred to as a practical carnot cycle because , when an efficient turbine is used , the ts diagram begins to resemble the carnot cycle . the main difference is that heat addition ( in the boiler ) and rejection ( in the condenser ) are isobaric ( constant pressure ) processes in the rankine cycle and isothermal ( constant temperature ) processes in the theoretical carnot cycle . in this cycle a pump is used to pressurize the working fluid which is received from the condenser as a liquid not as a gas . pumping the working fluid in liquid form during the cycle requires a small fraction of the energy to transport it compared to the energy needed to compress the working fluid in gaseous form in a compressor ( as in the carnot cycle ) . the cycle of a reciprocating steam engine differs from that of turbines because of condensation and re - evaporation occurring in the cylinder or in the steam inlet passages .	0	30

oxygen is a chemical element with symbol o and atomic number 8 . it is a member of the chalcogen group on the periodic table and is a highly reactive nonmetal and oxidizing agent that readily forms compounds ( notably oxides ) with most elements . by mass , oxygen is the third - most abundant element in the universe , after hydrogen and helium . at standard temperature and pressure , two atoms of the element bind to form dioxygen , a colorless and odorless diatomic gas with the formula o 2 . diatomic oxygen gas constitutes 20 . 8 % of the earth 's atmosphere . however , monitoring of atmospheric oxygen levels show a global downward trend , because of fossil - fuel burning . oxygen is the most abundant element by mass in the earth 's crust as part of oxide compounds such as silicon dioxide , making up almost half of the crust 's mass .	94	107
many major classes of organic molecules in living organisms , such as proteins , nucleic acids , carbohydrates , and fats , contain oxygen , as do the major inorganic compounds that are constituents of animal shells , teeth , and bone . most of the mass of living organisms is oxygen as it is a part of water , the major constituent of lifeforms . oxygen is used in cellular respiration and released by photosynthesis , which uses the energy of sunlight to produce oxygen from water . it is too chemically reactive to remain a free element in air without being continuously replenished by the photosynthetic action of living organisms . another form ( allotrope ) of oxygen , ozone ( o 3 ) , strongly absorbs uvb radiation and consequently the high - altitude ozone layer helps protect the biosphere from ultraviolet radiation , but is a pollutant near the surface where it is a by - product of smog . at even higher low earth orbit altitudes , sufficient atomic oxygen is present to cause erosion for spacecraft .	113	163
in the late 17th century , robert boyle proved that air is necessary for combustion . english chemist john mayow ( 1641 – 1679 ) refined this work by showing that fire requires only a part of air that he called spiritus nitroaereus or just nitroaereus . in one experiment he found that placing either a mouse or a lit candle in a closed container over water caused the water to rise and replace one - fourteenth of the air 's volume before extinguishing the subjects . from this he surmised that nitroaereus is consumed in both respiration and combustion .	16	46
in the meantime , on august 1 , 1774 , an experiment conducted by the british clergyman joseph priestley focused sunlight on mercuric oxide ( hgo ) inside a glass tube , which liberated a gas he named " dephlogisticated air " . he noted that candles burned brighter in the gas and that a mouse was more active and lived longer while breathing it . after breathing the gas himself , he wrote : " the feeling of it to my lungs was not sensibly different from that of common air , but i fancied that my breast felt peculiarly light and easy for some time afterwards . " priestley published his findings in 1775 in a paper titled " an account of further discoveries in air " which was included in the second volume of his book titled experiments and observations on different kinds of air . because he published his findings first , priestley is usually given priority in the discovery .	0	42

one of the first known experiments on the relationship between combustion and air was conducted by the 2nd century bce greek writer on mechanics , philo of byzantium . in his work pneumatica , philo observed that inverting a vessel over a burning candle and surrounding the vessel 's neck with water resulted in some water rising into the neck . philo incorrectly surmised that parts of the air in the vessel were converted into the classical element fire and thus were able to escape through pores in the glass . many centuries later leonardo da vinci built on philo 's work by observing that a portion of air is consumed during combustion and respiration .	91	115

oxygen is present in the atmosphere in trace quantities in the form of carbon dioxide ( co 2 ) . the earth 's crustal rock is composed in large part of oxides of silicon ( silica sio 2 , as found in granite and quartz ) , aluminium ( aluminium oxide al 2o 3 , in bauxite and corundum ) , iron ( iron ( iii ) oxide fe 2o 3 , in hematite and rust ) , and calcium carbonate ( in limestone ) . the rest of the earth 's crust is also made of oxygen compounds , in particular various complex silicates ( in silicate minerals ) . the earth 's mantle , of much larger mass than the crust , is largely composed of silicates of magnesium and iron .	0	19

john dalton 's original atomic hypothesis assumed that all elements were monatomic and that the atoms in compounds would normally have the simplest atomic ratios with respect to one another . for example , dalton assumed that water 's formula was ho , giving the atomic mass of oxygen as 8 times that of hydrogen , instead of the modern value of about 16 . in 1805 , joseph louis gay - lussac and alexander von humboldt showed that water is formed of two volumes of hydrogen and one volume of oxygen ; and by 1811 amedeo avogadro had arrived at the correct interpretation of water 's composition , based on what is now called avogadro 's law and the assumption of diatomic elemental molecules .

highly combustible materials that leave little residue , such as wood or coal , were thought to be made mostly of phlogiston ; whereas non - combustible substances that corrode , such as iron , contained very little . air did not play a role in phlogiston theory , nor were any initial quantitative experiments conducted to test the idea ; instead , it was based on observations of what happens when something burns , that most common objects appear to become lighter and seem to lose something in the process . the fact that a substance like wood gains overall weight in burning was hidden by the buoyancy of the gaseous combustion products . indeed , one of the first clues that the phlogiston theory was incorrect was that metals , too , gain weight in rusting ( when they were supposedly losing phlogiston ) .	0	38

this combination of cancellations and σ and π overlaps results in dioxygen 's double bond character and reactivity , and a triplet electronic ground state . an electron configuration with two unpaired electrons as found in dioxygen ( see the filled π * orbitals in the diagram ) , orbitals that are of equal energy — i . e . , degenerate — is a configuration termed a spin triplet state . hence , the ground state of the o 2 molecule is referred to as triplet oxygen . [ b ] the highest energy , partially filled orbitals are antibonding , and so their filling weakens the bond order from three to two . because of its unpaired electrons , triplet oxygen reacts only slowly with most organic molecules , which have paired electron spins ; this prevents spontaneous combustion .	115	141

in one experiment , lavoisier observed that there was no overall increase in weight when tin and air were heated in a closed container . he noted that air rushed in when he opened the container , which indicated that part of the trapped air had been consumed . he also noted that the tin had increased in weight and that increase was the same as the weight of the air that rushed back in . this and other experiments on combustion were documented in his book sur la combustion en general , which was published in 1777 . in that work , he proved that air is a mixture of two gases ; ' vital air ' , which is essential to combustion and respiration , and azote ( gk . αζωτον " lifeless " ) , which did not support either . azote later became nitrogen in english , although it has kept the name in french and several other european languages .	76	98

trioxygen ( o 3 ) is usually known as ozone and is a very reactive allotrope of oxygen that is damaging to lung tissue . ozone is produced in the upper atmosphere when o 2 combines with atomic oxygen made by the splitting of o 2 by ultraviolet ( uv ) radiation . since ozone absorbs strongly in the uv region of the spectrum , the ozone layer of the upper atmosphere functions as a protective radiation shield for the planet . near the earth 's surface , it is a pollutant formed as a by - product of automobile exhaust . the metastable molecule tetraoxygen ( o 4 ) was discovered in 2001 , and was assumed to exist in one of the six phases of solid oxygen . it was proven in 2006 that this phase , created by pressurizing o 2 to 20 gpa , is in fact a rhombohedral o 8 cluster . this cluster has the potential to be a much more powerful oxidizer than either o 2 or o 3 and may therefore be used in rocket fuel . a metallic phase was discovered in 1990 when solid oxygen is subjected to a pressure of above 96 gpa and it was shown in 1998 that at very low temperatures , this phase becomes superconducting .	25	52
the common allotrope of elemental oxygen on earth is called dioxygen , o 2 . it is the form that is a major part of the earth 's atmosphere ( see occurrence ) . o2 has a bond length of 121 pm and a bond energy of 498 kj · mol−1 , which is smaller than the energy of other double bonds or pairs of single bonds in the biosphere and responsible for the exothermic reaction of o2 with any organic molecule . due to its energy content , o2 is used by complex forms of life , such as animals , in cellular respiration ( see biological role ) . other aspects of o 2 are covered in the remainder of this article .	83	110

in 1891 scottish chemist james dewar was able to produce enough liquid oxygen to study . the first commercially viable process for producing liquid oxygen was independently developed in 1895 by german engineer carl von linde and british engineer william hampson . both men lowered the temperature of air until it liquefied and then distilled the component gases by boiling them off one at a time and capturing them . later , in 1901 , oxyacetylene welding was demonstrated for the first time by burning a mixture of acetylene and compressed o 2 . this method of welding and cutting metal later became common .	70	93

oxygen is more soluble in water than nitrogen is . water in equilibrium with air contains approximately 1 molecule of dissolved o 2 for every 2 molecules of n 2 , compared to an atmospheric ratio of approximately 1 : 4 . the solubility of oxygen in water is temperature - dependent , and about twice as much ( 14 . 6 mg · l−1 ) dissolves at 0 ° c than at 20 ° c ( 7 . 6 mg · l−1 ) . at 25 ° c and 1 standard atmosphere ( 101 . 3 kpa ) of air , freshwater contains about 6 . 04 milliliters ( ml ) of oxygen per liter , whereas seawater contains about 4 . 95 ml per liter . at 5 ° c the solubility increases to 9 . 0 ml ( 50 % more than at 25 ° c ) per liter for water and 7 . 2 ml ( 45 % more ) per liter for sea water .	0	9

singlet oxygen is a name given to several higher - energy species of molecular o 2 in which all the electron spins are paired . it is much more reactive towards common organic molecules than is molecular oxygen per se . in nature , singlet oxygen is commonly formed from water during photosynthesis , using the energy of sunlight . it is also produced in the troposphere by the photolysis of ozone by light of short wavelength , and by the immune system as a source of active oxygen . carotenoids in photosynthetic organisms ( and possibly also in animals ) play a major role in absorbing energy from singlet oxygen and converting it to the unexcited ground state before it can cause harm to tissues .	0	24
paleoclimatologists measure the ratio of oxygen - 18 and oxygen - 16 in the shells and skeletons of marine organisms to determine what the climate was like millions of years ago ( see oxygen isotope ratio cycle ) . seawater molecules that contain the lighter isotope , oxygen - 16 , evaporate at a slightly faster rate than water molecules containing the 12 % heavier oxygen - 18 ; this disparity increases at lower temperatures . during periods of lower global temperatures , snow and rain from that evaporated water tends to be higher in oxygen - 16 , and the seawater left behind tends to be higher in oxygen - 18 . marine organisms then incorporate more oxygen - 18 into their skeletons and shells than they would in a warmer climate . paleoclimatologists also directly measure this ratio in the water molecules of ice core samples that are up to several hundreds of thousands of years old .	0	38

in the triplet form , o 2 molecules are paramagnetic . that is , they impart magnetic character to oxygen when it is in the presence of a magnetic field , because of the spin magnetic moments of the unpaired electrons in the molecule , and the negative exchange energy between neighboring o 2 molecules . liquid oxygen is attracted to a magnet to a sufficient extent that , in laboratory demonstrations , a bridge of liquid oxygen may be supported against its own weight between the poles of a powerful magnet .

the unusually high concentration of oxygen gas on earth is the result of the oxygen cycle . this biogeochemical cycle describes the movement of oxygen within and between its three main reservoirs on earth : the atmosphere , the biosphere , and the lithosphere . the main driving factor of the oxygen cycle is photosynthesis , which is responsible for modern earth 's atmosphere . photosynthesis releases oxygen into the atmosphere , while respiration and decay remove it from the atmosphere . in the present equilibrium , production and consumption occur at the same rate of roughly 1 / 2000th of the entire atmospheric oxygen per year .	65	81

oxygen gas can also be produced through electrolysis of water into molecular oxygen and hydrogen . dc electricity must be used : if ac is used , the gases in each limb consist of hydrogen and oxygen in the explosive ratio 2 : 1 . contrary to popular belief , the 2 : 1 ratio observed in the dc electrolysis of acidified water does not prove that the empirical formula of water is h2o unless certain assumptions are made about the molecular formulae of hydrogen and oxygen themselves . a similar method is the electrocatalytic o 2 evolution from oxides and oxoacids . chemical catalysts can be used as well , such as in chemical oxygen generators or oxygen candles that are used as part of the life - support equipment on submarines , and are still part of standard equipment on commercial airliners in case of depressurization emergencies . another air separation technology involves forcing air to dissolve through ceramic membranes based on zirconium dioxide by either high pressure or an electric current , to produce nearly pure o 2 gas .	103	149

hyperbaric ( high - pressure ) medicine uses special oxygen chambers to increase the partial pressure of o 2 around the patient and , when needed , the medical staff . carbon monoxide poisoning , gas gangrene , and decompression sickness ( the ' bends ' ) are sometimes treated using these devices . increased o 2 concentration in the lungs helps to displace carbon monoxide from the heme group of hemoglobin . oxygen gas is poisonous to the anaerobic bacteria that cause gas gangrene , so increasing its partial pressure helps kill them . decompression sickness occurs in divers who decompress too quickly after a dive , resulting in bubbles of inert gas , mostly nitrogen and helium , forming in their blood . increasing the pressure of o 2 as soon as possible is part of the treatment .	73	94
people who climb mountains or fly in non - pressurized fixed - wing aircraft sometimes have supplemental o 2 supplies . [ h ] passengers traveling in ( pressurized ) commercial airplanes have an emergency supply of o 2 automatically supplied to them in case of cabin depressurization . sudden cabin pressure loss activates chemical oxygen generators above each seat , causing oxygen masks to drop . pulling on the masks " to start the flow of oxygen " as cabin safety instructions dictate , forces iron filings into the sodium chlorate inside the canister . a steady stream of oxygen gas is then produced by the exothermic reaction .	96	109
oxygen toxicity to the lungs and central nervous system can also occur in deep scuba diving and surface supplied diving . prolonged breathing of an air mixture with an o 2 partial pressure more than 60 kpa can eventually lead to permanent pulmonary fibrosis . exposure to a o 2 partial pressures greater than 160 kpa ( about 1 . 6 atm ) may lead to convulsions ( normally fatal for divers ) . acute oxygen toxicity ( causing seizures , its most feared effect for divers ) can occur by breathing an air mixture with 21 % o 2 at 66 m or more of depth ; the same thing can occur by breathing 100 % o 2 at only 6 m .	74	97

the crisis had a major impact on international relations and created a rift within nato . some european nations and japan sought to disassociate themselves from united states foreign policy in the middle east to avoid being targeted by the boycott . arab oil producers linked any future policy changes to peace between the belligerents . to address this , the nixon administration began multilateral negotiations with the combatants . they arranged for israel to pull back from the sinai peninsula and the golan heights . by january 18 , 1974 , us secretary of state henry kissinger had negotiated an israeli troop withdrawal from parts of the sinai peninsula . the promise of a negotiated settlement between israel and syria was enough to convince arab oil producers to lift the embargo in march 1974 .	56	69

the embargo had a negative influence on the us economy by causing immediate demands to address the threats to u . s . energy security . on an international level , the price increases changed competitive positions in many industries , such as automobiles . macroeconomic problems consisted of both inflationary and deflationary impacts . the embargo left oil companies searching for new ways to increase oil supplies , even in rugged terrain such as the arctic . finding oil and developing new fields usually required five to ten years before significant production .	45	54
the embargo was not uniform across europe . of the nine members of the european economic community ( eec ) , the netherlands faced a complete embargo , the uk and france received almost uninterrupted supplies ( having refused to allow america to use their airfields and embargoed arms and supplies to both the arabs and the israelis ) , while the other six faced partial cutbacks . the uk had traditionally been an ally of israel , and harold wilson 's government supported the israelis during the six - day war . his successor , ted heath , reversed this policy in 1970 , calling for israel to withdraw to its pre - 1967 borders .	68	92
despite being relatively unaffected by the embargo , the uk nonetheless faced an oil crisis of its own - a series of strikes by coal miners and railroad workers over the winter of 1973 – 74 became a major factor in the change of government . heath asked the british to heat only one room in their houses over the winter . the uk , germany , italy , switzerland and norway banned flying , driving and boating on sundays . sweden rationed gasoline and heating oil . the netherlands imposed prison sentences for those who used more than their ration of electricity .	0	45
price controls exacerbated the crisis in the us . the system limited the price of " old oil " ( that which had already been discovered ) while allowing newly discovered oil to be sold at a higher price to encourage investment . predictably , old oil was withdrawn from the market , creating greater scarcity . the rule also discouraged development of alternative energies . the rule had been intended to promote oil exploration . scarcity was addressed by rationing ( as in many countries ) . motorists faced long lines at gas stations beginning in summer 1972 and increasing by summer 1973 .	76	87

although lacking historical connections to the middle east , japan was the country most dependent on arab oil . 71 % of its imported oil came from the middle east in 1970 . on november 7 , 1973 , the saudi and kuwaiti governments declared japan a " nonfriendly " country to encourage it to change its noninvolvement policy . it received a 5 % production cut in december , causing a panic . on november 22 , japan issued a statement " asserting that israel should withdraw from all of the 1967 territories , advocating palestinian self - determination , and threatening to reconsider its policy toward israel if israel refused to accept these preconditions " . by december 25 , japan was considered an arab - friendly state .	0	18

the ussr 's invasion of afghanistan was only one sign of insecurity in the region , also marked by increased american weapons sales , technology , and outright military presence . saudi arabia and iran became increasingly dependent on american security assurances to manage both external and internal threats , including increased military competition between them over increased oil revenues . both states were competing for preeminence in the persian gulf and using increased revenues to fund expanded militaries . by 1979 , saudi arms purchases from the us exceeded five times israel 's . another motive for the large scale purchase of arms from the us by saudi arabia was the failure of the shah during january 1979 to maintain control of iran , a non - arabic but largely shiite muslim nation , which fell to a theocratic islamist government under the ayatollah ruhollah khomeini in the wake of the 1979 iranian revolution . saudi arabia , on the other hand , is an arab , largely sunni muslim nation headed by a near absolutist monarchy . in the wake of the iranian revolution the saudis were forced to deal with the prospect of internal destabilization via the radicalism of islamism , a reality which would quickly be revealed in the seizure of the grand mosque in mecca by wahhabi extremists during november 1979 and a shiite revolt in the oil rich al - hasa region of saudi arabia in december of the same year . in november 2010 , wikileaks leaked confidential diplomatic cables pertaining to the united states and its allies which revealed that the late saudi king abdullah urged the united states to attack iran in order to destroy its potential nuclear weapons program , describing iran as " a snake whose head should be cut off without any procrastination .

the crisis reduced the demand for large cars . japanese imports , primarily the toyota corona , the toyota corolla , the datsun b210 , the datsun 510 , the honda civic , the mitsubishi galant ( a captive import from chrysler sold as the dodge colt ) , the subaru dl , and later the honda accord all had four cylinder engines that were more fuel efficient than the typical american v8 and six cylinder engines . japanese imports became mass - market leaders with unibody construction and front - wheel drive , which became de facto standards .	9	77
compact trucks were introduced , such as the toyota hilux and the datsun truck , followed by the mazda truck ( sold as the ford courier ) , and the isuzu - built chevrolet luv . mitsubishi rebranded its forte as the dodge d - 50 a few years after the oil crisis . mazda , mitsubishi and isuzu had joint partnerships with ford , chrysler , and gm , respectively . later the american makers introduced their domestic replacements ( ford ranger , dodge dakota and the chevrolet s10 / gmc s - 15 ) , ending their captive import policy .	72	102

commissioners have various privileges , such as being exempt from member state taxes ( but not eu taxes ) , and having immunity from prosecution for doing official acts . commissioners have sometimes been found to have abused their offices , particularly since the santer commission was censured by parliament in 1999 , and it eventually resigned due to corruption allegations . this resulted in one main case , commission v edith cresson where the european court of justice held that a commissioner giving her dentist a job , for which he was clearly unqualified , did in fact not break any law . by contrast to the ecj 's relaxed approach , a committee of independent experts found that a culture had developed where few commissioners had ‘ even the slightest sense of responsibility ’ . this led to the creation of the european anti - fraud office . in 2012 it investigated the maltese commissioner for health , john dalli , who quickly resigned after allegations that he received a € 60 m bribe in connection with a tobacco products directive . beyond the commission , the european central bank has relative executive autonomy in its conduct of monetary policy for the purpose of managing the euro . it has a six - person board appointed by the european council , on the council 's recommendation . the president of the council and a commissioner can sit in on ecb meetings , but do not have voting rights .	62	103

to make new legislation , tfeu article 294 defines the " ordinary legislative procedure " that applies for most eu acts . the essence is there are three readings , starting with a commission proposal , where the parliament must vote by a majority of all meps ( not just those present ) to block or suggest changes , and the council must vote by qualified majority to approve changes , but by unanimity to block commission amendment . where the different institutions can not agree at any stage , a " conciliation committee " is convened , representing meps , ministers and the commission to try and get agreement on a joint text : if this works , it will be sent back to the parliament and council to approve by absolute and qualified majority . this means , legislation can be blocked by a majority in parliament , a minority in the council , and a majority in the commission : it is harder to change eu law than stay the same . a different procedure exists for budgets . for " enhanced cooperation " among a sub - set of at least member states , authorisation must be given by the council . member state governments should be informed by the commission at the outset before any proposals start the legislative procedure . the eu as a whole can only act within its power set out in the treaties . teu articles 4 and 5 state that powers remain with the member states unless they have been conferred , although there is a debate about the kompetenz - kompetenz question : who ultimately has the " competence " to define the eu 's " competence " . many member state courts believe they decide , other member state parliaments believe they decide , while within the eu , the court of justice believes it has the final say .	22	78

the judicial branch of the eu has played an important role in the development of eu law , by assuming the task of interpreting the treaties , and accelerating economic and political integration . today the court of justice of the european union ( cjeu ) is the main judicial body , within which there is a higher european court of justice ( commonly abbreviated as ecj ) that deals with cases that contain more public importance , and a general court that deals with issues of detail but without general importance . there is also a civil service tribunal to deal with eu staff issues , and then a separate court of auditors . under the treaty on european union article 19 ( 2 ) there is one judge from each member state , 28 at present , who are supposed to " possess the qualifications required for appointment to the highest judicial offices " ( or for the general court , the " ability required for appointment to high judicial office " ) . a president is elected by the judges for three years . under teu article 19 ( 3 ) is to be the ultimate court to interpret questions of eu law . in fact , most eu law is applied by member state courts ( the english court of appeal , the german bundesgerichtshof , the belgian cour du travail , etc . ) but they can refer questions to the eu court for a preliminary ruling . the cjeu 's duty is to " ensure that in the interpretation and application of the treaties the law is observed " , although realistically it has the ability to expand and develop the law according to the principles it deems to be appropriate . arguably this has been done through both seminal and controversial judgments , including van gend en loos , mangold v helm , and kadi v commission .	0	33

generally speaking , while all member states recognise that eu law takes primacy over national law where this agreed in the treaties , they do not accept that the court of justice has the final say on foundational constitutional questions affecting democracy and human rights . in the united kingdom , the basic principle is that parliament , as the sovereign expression of democratic legitimacy , can decide whether it wishes to expressly legislate against eu law . this , however , would only happen in the case of an express wish of the people to withdraw from the eu . it was held in r ( factortame ltd ) v secretary of state for transport that " whatever limitation of its sovereignty parliament accepted when it enacted the european communities act 1972 was entirely voluntary " and so " it has always been clear " that uk courts have a duty " to override any rule of national law found to be in conflict with any directly enforceable rule of community law . " more recently the uk supreme court noted that in r ( hs2 action alliance ltd ) v secretary of state for transport , although the uk constitution is uncodified , there could be " fundamental principles " of common law , and parliament " did not either contemplate or authorise the abrogation " of those principles when it enacted the european communities act 1972 . the view of the german constitutional court from the solange i and solange ii decisions is that if the eu does not comply with its basic constitutional rights and principles ( particularly democracy , the rule of law and the social state principles ) then it can not override german law . however , as the nicknames of the judgments go , " so long as " the eu works towards the democratisation of its institutions , and has a framework that protects fundamental human rights , it would not review eu legislation for compatibility with german constitutional principles . most other member states have expressed similar reservations . this suggests the eu 's legitimacy rests on the ultimate authority of member states , its factual commitment to human rights , and the democratic will of the people .	101	171

while constitutional law concerns the european union 's governance structure , administrative law binds eu institutions and member states to follow the law . both member states and the commission have a general legal right or " standing " ( locus standi ) to bring claims against eu institutions and other member states for breach of the treaties . from the eu 's foundation , the court of justice also held that the treaties allowed citizens or corporations to bring claims against eu and member state institutions for violation of the treaties and regulations , if they were properly interpreted as creating rights and obligations . however , under directives , citizens or corporations were said in 1986 to not be allowed to bring claims against other non - state parties . this meant courts of member states were not bound to apply an eu law where a national rule conflicted , even though the member state government could be sued , if it would impose an obligation on another citizen or corporation . these rules on " direct effect " limit the extent to which member state courts are bound to administer eu law . all actions by eu institutions can be subject to judicial review , and judged by standards of proportionality , particularly where general principles of law , or fundamental rights are engaged . the remedy for a claimant where there has been a breach of the law is often monetary damages , but courts can also require specific performance or will grant an injunction , in order to ensure the law is effective as possible .	0	23

while the treaties and regulations will have direct effect ( if clear , unconditional and immediate ) , directives do not generally give citizens ( as opposed to the member state ) standing to sue other citizens . in theory , this is because tfeu article 288 says directives are addressed to the member states and usually " leave to the national authorities the choice of form and methods " to implement . in part this reflects that directives often create minimum standards , leaving member states to apply higher standards . for example , the working time directive requires that every worker has at least 4 weeks paid holidays each year , but most member states require more than 28 days in national law . however , on the current position adopted by the court of justice , citizens have standing to make claims based on national laws that implement directives , but not from directives themselves . directives do not have so called " horizontal " direct effect ( i . e . between non - state parties ) . this view was instantly controversial , and in the early 1990s three advocate generals persuasively argued that directives should create rights and duties for all citizens . the court of justice refused , but there are five large exceptions .	0	37

first , if a directive 's deadline for implementation is not met , the member state can not enforce conflicting laws , and a citizen may rely on the directive in such an action ( so called " vertical " direct effect ) . so , in pubblico ministero v ratti because the italian government had failed to implement a directive 73 / 173 / eec on packaging and labelling solvents by the deadline , it was estopped from enforcing a conflicting national law from 1963 against mr ratti 's solvent and varnish business . a member state could " not rely , as against individuals , on its own failure to perform the obligations which the directive entails . " second , a citizen or company can invoke a directive , not just in a dispute with a public authority , but in a dispute with another citizen or company . so , in cia security v signalson and securitel the court of justice held that a business called cia security could defend itself from allegations by competitors that it had not complied with a belgian decree from 1991 about alarm systems , on the basis that it had not been notified to the commission as a directive required . third , if a directive gives expression to a " general principle " of eu law , it can be invoked between private non - state parties before its deadline for implementation . this follows from kucukdeveci v swedex gmbh & co kg where the german civil code § 622 stated that the years people worked under the age of 25 would not count towards the increasing statutory notice before dismissal . ms kucukdeveci worked for 10 years , from age 18 to 28 , for swedex gmbh & co kg before her dismissal . she claimed that the law not counting her years under age 25 was unlawful age discrimination under the employment equality framework directive . the court of justice held that the directive could be relied on by her because equality was also a general principle of eu law . third , if the defendant is an emanation of the state , even if not central government , it can still be bound by directives . in foster v british gas plc the court of justice held that mrs foster was entitled to bring a sex discrimination claim against her employer , british gas plc , which made women retire at age 60 and men at 65 , if ( 1 ) pursuant to a state measure , ( 2 ) it provided a public service , and ( 3 ) had special powers . this could also be true if the enterprise is privatised , as it was held with a water company that was responsible for basic water provision .	0	43
fourth , national courts have a duty to interpret domestic law " as far as possible in the light of the wording and purpose of the directive " . textbooks ( though not the court itself ) often called this " indirect effect " . in marleasing sa v la comercial sa the court of justice held that a spanish court had to interpret its general civil code provisions , on contracts lacking cause or defrauding creditors , to conform with the first company law directive article 11 , that required incorporations would only be nullified for a fixed list of reasons . the court of justice quickly acknowledged that the duty of interpretation can not contradict plain words in a national statute . but , fifth , if a member state has failed to implement a directive , a citizen may not be able to bring claims against other non - state parties , but can sue the member state itself for failure to implement the law . so , in francovich v italy , the italian government had failed to set up an insurance fund for employees to claim unpaid wages if their employers had gone insolvent , as the insolvency protection directive required . francovich , the former employee of a bankrupt venetian firm , was therefore allowed to claim 6 million lira from the italian government in damages for his loss . the court of justice held that if a directive would confer identifiable rights on individuals , and there is a causal link between a member state 's violation of eu and a claimant 's loss , damages must be paid . the fact that the incompatible law is an act of parliament is no defence .	207	235

the principles of european union law are rules of law which have been developed by the european court of justice that constitute unwritten rules which are not expressly provided for in the treaties but which affect how european union law is interpreted and applies . in formulating these principles , the courts have drawn on a variety of sources , including : public international law and legal doctrines and principles present in the legal systems of european union member states and in the jurisprudence of the european court of human rights . accepted general principles of european union law include fundamental rights ( see human rights ) , proportionality , legal certainty , equality before the law and subsidiarity .	0	44
proportionality is recognised one of the general principles of european union law by the european court of justice since the 1950s . according to the general principle of proportionality the lawfulness of an action depends on whether it was appropriate and necessary to achieve the objectives legitimately pursued . when there is a choice between several appropriate measures the least onerous must be adopted , and any disadvantage caused must not be disproportionate to the aims pursued . the principle of proportionality is also recognised in article 5 of the ec treaty , stating that " any action by the community shall not go beyond what is necessary to achieve the objectives of this treaty " .	78	116

the concept of legal certainty is recognised one of the general principles of european union law by the european court of justice since the 1960s . it is an important general principle of international law and public law , which predates european union law . as a general principle in european union law it means that the law must be certain , in that it is clear and precise , and its legal implications foreseeable , specially when applied to financial obligations . the adoption of laws which will have legal effect in the european union must have a proper legal basis . legislation in member states which implements european union law must be worded so that it is clearly understandable by those who are subject to the law . in european union law the general principle of legal certainty prohibits ex post facto laws , i . e . laws should not take effect before they are published . the doctrine of legitimate expectation , which has its roots in the principles of legal certainty and good faith , is also a central element of the general principle of legal certainty in european union law . the legitimate expectation doctrine holds that and that " those who act in good faith on the basis of law as it is or seems to be should not be frustrated in their expectations " .	26	44
none of the original treaties establishing the european union mention protection for fundamental rights . it was not envisaged for european union measures , that is legislative and administrative actions by european union institutions , to be subject to human rights . at the time the only concern was that member states should be prevented from violating human rights , hence the establishment of the european convention on human rights in 1950 and the establishment of the european court of human rights . the european court of justice recognised fundamental rights as general principle of european union law as the need to ensure that european union measures are compatible with the human rights enshrined in member states ' constitution became ever more apparent . in 1999 the european council set up a body tasked with drafting a european charter of human rights , which could form the constitutional basis for the european union and as such tailored specifically to apply to the european union and its institutions . the charter of fundamental rights of the european union draws a list of fundamental rights from the european convention on human rights and fundamental freedoms , the declaration on fundamental rights produced by the european parliament in 1989 and european union treaties .	42	82

the social charter was subsequently adopted in 1989 by 11 of the then 12 member states . the uk refused to sign the social charter and was exempt from the legislation covering social charter issues unless it agreed to be bound by the legislation . the uk subsequently was the only member state to veto the social charter being included as the " social chapter " of the 1992 maastricht treaty - instead , an agreement on social policy was added as a protocol . again , the uk was exempt from legislation arising from the protocol , unless it agreed to be bound by it . the protocol was to become known as " social chapter " , despite not actually being a chapter of the maastricht treaty . to achieve aims of the agreement on social policy the european union was to " support and complement " the policies of member states . the aims of the agreement on social policy are :	17	44

following the election of the uk labour party to government in 1997 , the uk formally subscribed to the agreement on social policy , which allowed it to be included with minor amendments as the social chapter of the 1997 treaty of amsterdam . the uk subsequently adopted the main legislation previously agreed under the agreement on social policy , the 1994 works council directive , which required workforce consultation in businesses , and the 1996 parental leave directive . in the 10 years following the 1997 treaty of amsterdam and adoption of the social chapter the european union has undertaken policy initiatives in various social policy areas , including labour and industry relations , equal opportunity , health and safety , public health , protection of children , the disabled and elderly , poverty , migrant workers , education , training and youth .	0	43

eu competition law has its origins in the european coal and steel community ( ecsc ) agreement between france , italy , belgium , the netherlands , luxembourg and germany in 1951 following the second world war . the agreement aimed to prevent germany from re - establishing dominance in the production of coal and steel as members felt that its dominance had contributed to the outbreak of the war . article 65 of the agreement banned cartels and article 66 made provisions for concentrations , or mergers , and the abuse of a dominant position by companies . this was the first time that competition law principles were included in a plurilateral regional agreement and established the trans - european model of competition law . in 1957 competition rules were included in the treaty of rome , also known as the ec treaty , which established the european economic community ( eec ) . the treaty of rome established the enactment of competition law as one of the main aims of the eec through the " institution of a system ensuring that competition in the common market is not distorted " . the two central provisions on eu competition law on companies were established in article 85 , which prohibited anti - competitive agreements , subject to some exemptions , and article 86 prohibiting the abuse of dominant position . the treaty also established principles on competition law for member states , with article 90 covering public undertakings , and article 92 making provisions on state aid . regulations on mergers were not included as member states could not establish consensus on the issue at the time .	0	37
today , the treaty of lisbon prohibits anti - competitive agreements in article 101 ( 1 ) , including price fixing . according to article 101 ( 2 ) any such agreements are automatically void . article 101 ( 3 ) establishes exemptions , if the collusion is for distributional or technological innovation , gives consumers a " fair share " of the benefit and does not include unreasonable restraints that risk eliminating competition anywhere ( or compliant with the general principle of european union law of proportionality ) . article 102 prohibits the abuse of dominant position , such as price discrimination and exclusive dealing . article 102 allows the european council to regulations to govern mergers between firms ( the current regulation is the regulation 139 / 2004 / ec ) . the general test is whether a concentration ( i . e . merger or acquisition ) with a community dimension ( i . e . affects a number of eu member states ) might significantly impede effective competition . articles 106 and 107 provide that member state 's right to deliver public services may not be obstructed , but that otherwise public enterprises must adhere to the same competition principles as companies . article 107 lays down a general rule that the state may not aid or subsidise private parties in distortion of free competition and provides exemptions for charities , regional development objectives and in the event of a natural disaster .	173	206
while the concept of a " social market economy " was only introduced into eu law in 2007 , free movement and trade were central to european development since the treaty of rome 1957 . according to the standard theory of comparative advantage , two countries can both benefit from trade even if one of them has a less productive economy in all respects . like in other regional organisations such as the north american free trade association , or the world trade organisation , breaking down barriers to trade , and enhancing free movement of goods , services , labour and capital , is meant to reduce consumer prices . it was originally theorised that a free trade area had a tendency to give way to a customs union , which led to a common market , then monetary union , then union of monetary and fiscal policy , political and eventually a full union characteristic of a federal state . in europe , however , those stages were considerably mixed , and it remains unclear whether the " endgame " should be the same as a state , traditionally understood . in practice free trade , without standards to ensure fair trade , can benefit some people and groups within countries ( particularly big business ) much more than others , but will burden people who lack bargaining power in an expanding market , particularly workers , consumers , small business , developing industries , and communities . the treaty on the functioning of the european union articles 28 to 37 establish the principle of free movement of goods in the eu , while articles 45 to 66 require free movement of persons , services and capital . these so - called " four freedoms " were thought to be inhibited by physical barriers ( e . g . customs ) , technical barriers ( e . g . differing laws on safety , consumer or environmental standards ) and fiscal barriers ( e . g . different value added tax rates ) . the tension in the law is that the free movement and trade is not supposed to spill over into a licence for unrestricted commercial profit . the treaties limit free trade , to prioritise other values such as public health , consumer protection , labour rights , fair competition , and environmental improvement . increasingly the court of justice has taken the view that the specific goals of free trade are underpinned by the general aims of the treaty for improvement of people 's well being .	400	432
free movement of goods within the european union is achieved by a customs union , and the principle of non - discrimination . the eu manages imports from non - member states , duties between member states are prohibited , and imports circulate freely . in addition under the treaty on the functioning of the european union article 34 , ‘ quantitative restrictions on imports and all measures having equivalent effect shall be prohibited between member states ’ . in procureur du roi v dassonville the court of justice held that this rule meant all " trading rules " that are " enacted by member states " which could hinder trade " directly or indirectly , actually or potentially " would be caught by article 34 . this meant that a belgian law requiring scotch whisky imports to have a certificate of origin was unlikely to be lawful . it discriminated against parallel importers like mr dassonville , who could not get certificates from authorities in france , where they bought the scotch . this " wide test " , to determine what could potentially be an unlawful restriction on trade , applies equally to actions by quasi - government bodies , such as the former " buy irish " company that had government appointees . it also means states can be responsible for private actors . for instance , in commission v france french farmer vigilantes were continually sabotaging shipments of spanish strawberries , and even belgian tomato imports . france was liable for these hindrances to trade because the authorities ‘ manifestly and persistently abstained ' from preventing the sabotage . generally speaking , if a member state has laws or practices that directly discriminate against imports ( or exports under tfeu article 35 ) then it must be justified under article 36 . the justifications include public morality , policy or security , " protection of health and life of humans , animals or plants " , " national treasures " of " artistic , historic or archaeological value " and " industrial and commercial property . " in addition , although not clearly listed , environmental protection can justify restrictions on trade as an overriding requirement derived from tfeu article 11 . more generally , it has been increasingly acknowledged that fundamental human rights should take priority over all trade rules . so , in schmidberger v austria the court of justice held that austria did not infringe article 34 by failing to ban a protest that blocked heavy traffic passing over the a13 , brenner autobahn , en route to italy . although many companies , including mr schmidberger 's german undertaking , were prevented from trading , the court of justice reasoned that freedom of association is one of the ‘ fundamental pillars of a democratic society ’ , against which the free movement of goods had to be balanced , and was probably subordinate . if a member state does appeal to the article 36 justification , the measures it takes have to be applied proportionately . this means the rule must be pursue a legitimate aim and ( 1 ) be suitable to achieve the aim , ( 2 ) be necessary , so that a less restrictive measure could not achieve the same result , and ( 3 ) be reasonable in balancing the interests of free trade with interests in article 36 .	227	250

often rules apply to all goods neutrally , but may have a greater practical effect on imports than domestic products . for such " indirect " discriminatory ( or " indistinctly applicable " ) measures the court of justice has developed more justifications : either those in article 36 , or additional " mandatory " or " overriding " requirements such as consumer protection , improving labour standards , protecting the environment , press diversity , fairness in commerce , and more : the categories are not closed . in the most famous case rewe - zentral ag v bundesmonopol fur branntwein , the court of justice found that a german law requiring all spirits and liqueurs ( not just imported ones ) to have a minimum alcohol content of 25 per cent was contrary to tfeu article 34 , because it had a greater negative effect on imports . german liqueurs were over 25 per cent alcohol , but cassis de dijon , which rewe - zentrale ag wished to import from france , only had 15 to 20 per cent alcohol . the court of justice rejected the german government 's arguments that the measure proportionately protected public health under tfeu article 36 , because stronger beverages were available and adequate labelling would be enough for consumers to understand what they bought . this rule primarily applies to requirements about a product 's content or packaging . in walter rau lebensmittelwerke v de smedt pvba the court of justice found that a belgian law requiring all margarine to be in cube shaped packages infringed article 34 , and was not justified by the pursuit of consumer protection . the argument that belgians would believe it was butter if it was not cube shaped was disproportionate : it would " considerably exceed the requirements of the object in view " and labelling would protect consumers " just as effectively " . in a 2003 case , commission v italy italian law required that cocoa products that included other vegetable fats could not be labelled as " chocolate " . it had to be " chocolate substitute " . all italian chocolate was made from cocoa butter alone , but british , danish and irish manufacturers used other vegetable fats . they claimed the law infringed article 34 . the court of justice held that a low content of vegetable fat did not justify a " chocolate substitute " label . this was derogatory in the consumers ' eyes . a ‘ neutral and objective statement ’ was enough to protect consumers . if member states place considerable obstacles on the use of a product , this can also infringe article 34 . so , in a 2009 case , commission v italy , the court of justice held that an italian law prohibiting motorcycles or mopeds pulling trailers infringed article 34 . again , the law applied neutrally to everyone , but disproportionately affected importers , because italian companies did not make trailers . this was not a product requirement , but the court reasoned that the prohibition would deter people from buying it : it would have " a considerable influence on the behaviour of consumers " that " affects the access of that product to the market " . it would require justification under article 36 , or as a mandatory requirement .	89	149

in contrast to product requirements or other laws that hinder market access , the court of justice developed a presumption that " selling arrangements " would be presumed to not fall into tfeu article 34 , if they applied equally to all sellers , and affected them in the same manner in fact . in keck and mithouard two importers claimed that their prosecution under a french competition law , which prevented them selling picon beer under wholesale price , was unlawful . the aim of the law was to prevent cut throat competition , not to hinder trade . the court of justice held , as " in law and in fact " it was an equally applicable " selling arrangement " ( not something that alters a product 's content ) it was outside the scope of article 34 , and so did not need to be justified . selling arrangements can be held to have an unequal effect " in fact " particularly where traders from another member state are seeking to break into the market , but there are restrictions on advertising and marketing . in konsumentombudsmannen v de agostini the court of justice reviewed swedish bans on advertising to children under age 12 , and misleading commercials for skin care products . while the bans have remained ( justifiable under article 36 or as a mandatory requirement ) the court emphasised that complete marketing bans could be disproportionate if advertising were " the only effective form of promotion enabling [ a trader ] to penetrate " the market . in konsumentombudsmannen v gourmet ab the court suggested that a total ban for advertising alcohol on the radio , tv and in magazines could fall within article 34 where advertising was the only way for sellers to overcome consumers ' " traditional social practices and to local habits and customs " to buy their products , but again the national courts would decide whether it was justified under article 36 to protect public health . under the unfair commercial practices directive , the eu harmonised restrictions on restrictions on marketing and advertising , to forbid conduct that distorts average consumer behaviour , is misleading or aggressive , and sets out a list of examples that count as unfair . increasingly , states have to give mutual recognition to each other 's standards of regulation , while the eu has attempted to harmonise minimum ideals of best practice . the attempt to raise standards is hoped to avoid a regulatory " race to the bottom " , while allowing consumers access to goods from around the continent .	189	216

since its foundation , the treaties sought to enable people to pursue their life goals in any country through free movement . reflecting the economic nature of the project , the european community originally focused upon free movement of workers : as a " factor of production " . however , from the 1970s , this focus shifted towards developing a more " social " europe . free movement was increasingly based on " citizenship " , so that people had rights to empower them to become economically and socially active , rather than economic activity being a precondition for rights . this means the basic " worker " rights in tfeu article 45 function as a specific expression of the general rights of citizens in tfeu articles 18 to 21 . according to the court of justice , a " worker " is anybody who is economically active , which includes everyone in an employment relationship , " under the direction of another person " for " remuneration " . a job , however , need not be paid in money for someone to be protected as a worker . for example , in steymann v staatssecretaris van justitie , a german man claimed the right to residence in the netherlands , while he volunteered plumbing and household duties in the bhagwan community , which provided for everyone 's material needs irrespective of their contributions . the court of justice held that mr steymann was entitled to stay , so long as there was at least an " indirect quid pro quo " for the work he did . having " worker " status means protection against all forms of discrimination by governments , and employers , in access to employment , tax , and social security rights . by contrast a citizen , who is " any person having the nationality of a member state " ( tfeu article 20 ( 1 ) ) , has rights to seek work , vote in local and european elections , but more restricted rights to claim social security . in practice , free movement has become politically contentious as nationalist political parties have manipulated fears about immigrants taking away people 's jobs and benefits ( paradoxically at the same time ) . nevertheless , practically " all available research finds little impact " of " labour mobility on wages and employment of local workers " .	237	269

the free movement of workers regulation articles 1 to 7 set out the main provisions on equal treatment of workers . first , articles 1 to 4 generally require that workers can take up employment , conclude contracts , and not suffer discrimination compared to nationals of the member state . in a famous case , the belgian football association v bosman , a belgian footballer named jean - marc bosman claimed that he should be able to transfer from r . f . c . de liege to usl dunkerque when his contract finished , regardless of whether dunkerque could afford to pay liege the habitual transfer fees . the court of justice held " the transfer rules constitute [ d ] an obstacle to free movement " and were unlawful unless they could be justified in the public interest , but this was unlikely . in groener v minister for education the court of justice accepted that a requirement to speak gaelic to teach in a dublin design college could be justified as part of the public policy of promoting the irish language , but only if the measure was not disproportionate . by contrast in angonese v cassa di risparmio di bolzano spa a bank in bolzano , italy , was not allowed to require mr angonese to have a bilingual certificate that could only be obtained in bolzano . the court of justice , giving " horizontal " direct effect to tfeu article 45 , reasoned that people from other countries would have little chance of acquiring the certificate , and because it was " impossible to submit proof of the required linguistic knowledge by any other means " , the measure was disproportionate . second , article 7 ( 2 ) requires equal treatment in respect of tax . in finanzamt koln altstadt v schumacker the court of justice held that it contravened tfeu art 45 to deny tax benefits ( e . g . for married couples , and social insurance expense deductions ) to a man who worked in germany , but was resident in belgium when other german residents got the benefits . by contrast in weigel v finanzlandesdirektion fur vorarlberg the court of justice rejected mr weigel 's claim that a re - registration charge upon bringing his car to austria violated his right to free movement . although the tax was " likely to have a negative bearing on the decision of migrant workers to exercise their right to freedom of movement " , because the charge applied equally to austrians , in absence of eu legislation on the matter it had to be regarded as justified . third , people must receive equal treatment regarding " social advantages " , although the court has approved residential qualifying periods . in hendrix v employee insurance institute the court of justice held that a dutch national was not entitled to continue receiving incapacity benefits when he moved to belgium , because the benefit was " closely linked to the socio - economic situation " of the netherlands . conversely , in geven v land nordrhein - westfalen the court of justice held that a dutch woman living in the netherlands , but working between 3 and 14 hours a week in germany , did not have a right to receive german child benefits , even though the wife of a man who worked full - time in germany but was resident in austria could . the general justifications for limiting free movement in tfeu article 45 ( 3 ) are " public policy , public security or public health " , and there is also a general exception in article 45 ( 4 ) for " employment in the public service " .	51	109

in 2006 , a toxic waste spill off the coast of cote d'ivoire , from a european ship , prompted the commission to look into legislation against toxic waste . environment commissioner stavros dimas stated that " such highly toxic waste should never have left the european union " . with countries such as spain not even having a crime against shipping toxic waste , franco frattini , the justice , freedom and security commissioner , proposed with dimas to create criminal sentences for " ecological crimes " . the competence for the union to do this was contested in 2005 at the court of justice resulting in a victory for the commission . that ruling set a precedent that the commission , on a supranational basis , may legislate in criminal law – something never done before . so far , the only other proposal has been the draft intellectual property rights directive . motions were tabled in the european parliament against that legislation on the basis that criminal law should not be an eu competence , but was rejected at vote . however , in october 2007 , the court of justice ruled that the commission could not propose what the criminal sanctions could be , only that there must be some .	0	29

the " freedom to provide services " under tfeu article 56 applies to people who give services " for remuneration " , especially commercial or professional activity . for example , in van binsbergen v bestuur van de bedrijfvereniging voor de metaalnijverheid a dutch lawyer moved to belgium while advising a client in a social security case , and was told he could not continue because dutch law said only people established in the netherlands could give legal advice . the court of justice held that the freedom to provide services applied , it was directly effective , and the rule was probably unjustified : having an address in the member state would be enough to pursue the legitimate aim of good administration of justice . the court of justice has held that secondary education falls outside the scope of article 56 , because usually the state funds it , though higher education does not . health care generally counts as a service . in geraets - smits v stichting ziekenfonds mrs geraets - smits claimed she should be reimbursed by dutch social insurance for costs of receiving treatment in germany . the dutch health authorities regarded the treatment unnecessary , so she argued this restricted the freedom ( of the german health clinic ) to provide services . several governments submitted that hospital services should not be regarded as economic , and should not fall within article 56 . but the court of justice held health was a " service " even though the government ( rather than the service recipient ) paid for the service . national authorities could be justified in refusing to reimburse patients for medical services abroad if the health care received at home was without undue delay , and it followed " international medical science " on which treatments counted as normal and necessary . the court requires that the individual circumstances of a patient justify waiting lists , and this is also true in the context of the uk 's national health service . aside from public services , another sensitive field of services are those classified as illegal . josemans v burgemeester van maastricht held that the netherlands ' regulation of cannabis consumption , including the prohibitions by some municipalities on tourists ( but not dutch nationals ) going to coffee shops , fell outside article 56 altogether . the court of justice reasoned that narcotic drugs were controlled in all member states , and so this differed from other cases where prostitution or other quasi - legal activity was subject to restriction . if an activity does fall within article 56 , a restriction can be justified under article 52 or overriding requirements developed by the court of justice . in alpine investments bv v minister van financien a business that sold commodities futures ( with merrill lynch and another banking firms ) attempted to challenge a dutch law that prohibiting cold calling customers . the court of justice held the dutch prohibition pursued a legitimate aim to prevent " undesirable developments in securities trading " including protecting the consumer from aggressive sales tactics , thus maintaining confidence in the dutch markets . in omega spielhallen gmbh v bonn a " laserdrome " business was banned by the bonn council . it bought fake laser gun services from a uk firm called pulsar ltd , but residents had protested against " playing at killing " entertainment . the court of justice held that the german constitutional value of human dignity , which underpinned the ban , did count as a justified restriction on freedom to provide services . in liga portuguesa de futebol v santa casa da misericordia de lisboa the court of justice also held that the state monopoly on gambling , and a penalty for a gibraltar firm that had sold internet gambling services , was justified to prevent fraud and gambling where people 's views were highly divergent . the ban was proportionate as this was an appropriate and necessary way to tackle the serious problems of fraud that arise over the internet . in the services directive a group of justifications were codified in article 16 that the case law has developed .	192	218
in regard to companies , the court of justice held in r ( daily mail and general trust plc ) v hm treasury that member states could restrict a company moving its seat of business , without infringing tfeu article 49 . this meant the daily mail newspaper 's parent company could not evade tax by shifting its residence to the netherlands without first settling its tax bills in the uk . the uk did not need to justify its action , as rules on company seats were not yet harmonised . by contrast , in centros ltd v erhversus - og selkabssyrelsen the court of justice found that a uk limited company operating in denmark could not be required to comply with denmark 's minimum share capital rules . uk law only required £ 1 of capital to start a company , while denmark 's legislature took the view companies should only be started up if they had 200 , 000 danish krone ( around € 27 , 000 ) to protect creditors if the company failed and went insolvent . the court of justice held that denmark 's minimum capital law infringed centros ltd 's freedom of establishment and could not be justified , because a company in the uk could admittedly provide services in denmark without being established there , and there were less restrictive means of achieving the aim of creditor protection . this approach was criticised as potentially opening the eu to unjustified regulatory competition , and a race to the bottom in standards , like in the us where the state delaware attracts most companies and is often argued to have the worst standards of accountability of boards , and low corporate taxes as a result . similarly in uberseering bv v nordic construction gmbh the court of justice held that a german court could not deny a dutch building company the right to enforce a contract in germany on the basis that it was not validly incorporated in germany . although restrictions on freedom of establishment could be justified by creditor protection , labour rights to participate in work , or the public interest in collecting taxes , denial of capacity went too far : it was an " outright negation " of the right of establishment . however , in cartesio oktato es szolgaltato bt the court of justice affirmed again that because corporations are created by law , they are in principle subject to any rules for formation that a state of incorporation wishes to impose . this meant that the hungarian authorities could prevent a company from shifting its central administration to italy while it still operated and was incorporated in hungary . thus , the court draws a distinction between the right of establishment for foreign companies ( where restrictions must be justified ) , and the right of the state to determine conditions for companies incorporated in its territory , although it is not entirely clear why .	130	181

the amazon rainforest ( portuguese : floresta amazonica or amazonia ; spanish : selva amazonica , amazonia or usually amazonia ; french : foret amazonienne ; dutch : amazoneregenwoud ) , also known in english as amazonia or the amazon jungle , is a moist broadleaf forest that covers most of the amazon basin of south america . this basin encompasses 7 , 000 , 000 square kilometres ( 2 , 700 , 000 sq mi ) , of which 5 , 500 , 000 square kilometres ( 2 , 100 , 000 sq mi ) are covered by the rainforest . this region includes territory belonging to nine nations . the majority of the forest is contained within brazil , with 60 % of the rainforest , followed by peru with 13 % , colombia with 10 % , and with minor amounts in venezuela , ecuador , bolivia , guyana , suriname and french guiana . states or departments in four nations contain " amazonas " in their names . the amazon represents over half of the planet 's remaining rainforests , and comprises the largest and most biodiverse tract of tropical rainforest in the world , with an estimated 390 billion individual trees divided into 16 , 000 species .	0	22
following the cretaceous – paleogene extinction event , the extinction of the dinosaurs and the wetter climate may have allowed the tropical rainforest to spread out across the continent . from 66 – 34 mya , the rainforest extended as far south as 45 ° . climate fluctuations during the last 34 million years have allowed savanna regions to expand into the tropics . during the oligocene , for example , the rainforest spanned a relatively narrow band . it expanded again during the middle miocene , then retracted to a mostly inland formation at the last glacial maximum . however , the rainforest still managed to thrive during these glacial periods , allowing for the survival and evolution of a broad diversity of species .	0	29
during the mid - eocene , it is believed that the drainage basin of the amazon was split along the middle of the continent by the purus arch . water on the eastern side flowed toward the atlantic , while to the west water flowed toward the pacific across the amazonas basin . as the andes mountains rose , however , a large basin was created that enclosed a lake ; now known as the solimoes basin . within the last 5 – 10 million years , this accumulating water broke through the purus arch , joining the easterly flow toward the atlantic .	29	52

there is evidence that there have been significant changes in amazon rainforest vegetation over the last 21 , 000 years through the last glacial maximum ( lgm ) and subsequent deglaciation . analyses of sediment deposits from amazon basin paleolakes and from the amazon fan indicate that rainfall in the basin during the lgm was lower than for the present , and this was almost certainly associated with reduced moist tropical vegetation cover in the basin . there is debate , however , over how extensive this reduction was . some scientists argue that the rainforest was reduced to small , isolated refugia separated by open forest and grassland ; other scientists argue that the rainforest remained largely intact but extended less far to the north , south , and east than is seen today . this debate has proved difficult to resolve because the practical limitations of working in the rainforest mean that data sampling is biased away from the center of the amazon basin , and both explanations are reasonably well supported by the available data .	0	31

for a long time , it was thought that the amazon rainforest was only ever sparsely populated , as it was impossible to sustain a large population through agriculture given the poor soil . archeologist betty meggers was a prominent proponent of this idea , as described in her book amazonia : man and culture in a counterfeit paradise . she claimed that a population density of 0 . 2 inhabitants per square kilometre ( 0 . 52 / sq mi ) is the maximum that can be sustained in the rainforest through hunting , with agriculture needed to host a larger population . however , recent anthropological findings have suggested that the region was actually densely populated . some 5 million people may have lived in the amazon region in ad 1500 , divided between dense coastal settlements , such as that at marajo , and inland dwellers . by 1900 the population had fallen to 1 million and by the early 1980s it was less than 200 , 000 .	34	59

terra preta ( black earth ) , which is distributed over large areas in the amazon forest , is now widely accepted as a product of indigenous soil management . the development of this fertile soil allowed agriculture and silviculture in the previously hostile environment ; meaning that large portions of the amazon rainforest are probably the result of centuries of human management , rather than naturally occurring as has previously been supposed . in the region of the xingu tribe , remains of some of these large settlements in the middle of the amazon forest were found in 2003 by michael heckenberger and colleagues of the university of florida . among those were evidence of roads , bridges and large plazas .	74	110

deforestation is the conversion of forested areas to non - forested areas . the main sources of deforestation in the amazon are human settlement and development of the land . prior to the early 1960s , access to the forest 's interior was highly restricted , and the forest remained basically intact . farms established during the 1960s were based on crop cultivation and the slash and burn method . however , the colonists were unable to manage their fields and the crops because of the loss of soil fertility and weed invasion . the soils in the amazon are productive for just a short period of time , so farmers are constantly moving to new areas and clearing more land . these farming practices led to deforestation and caused extensive environmental damage . deforestation is considerable , and areas cleared of forest are visible to the naked eye from outer space .	30	52

the needs of soy farmers have been used to justify many of the controversial transportation projects that are currently developing in the amazon . the first two highways successfully opened up the rainforest and led to increased settlement and deforestation . the mean annual deforestation rate from 2000 to 2005 ( 22 , 392 km2 or 8 , 646 sq mi per year ) was 18 % higher than in the previous five years ( 19 , 018 km2 or 7 , 343 sq mi per year ) . although deforestation has declined significantly in the brazilian amazon between 2004 and 2014 , there has been an increase to the present day .	0	23
environmentalists are concerned about loss of biodiversity that will result from destruction of the forest , and also about the release of the carbon contained within the vegetation , which could accelerate global warming . amazonian evergreen forests account for about 10 % of the world 's terrestrial primary productivity and 10 % of the carbon stores in ecosystems — of the order of 1 . 1 × 1011 metric tonnes of carbon . amazonian forests are estimated to have accumulated 0 . 62 ± 0 . 37 tons of carbon per hectare per year between 1975 and 1996 .	35	73

the use of remote sensing for the conservation of the amazon is also being used by the indigenous tribes of the basin to protect their tribal lands from commercial interests . using handheld gps devices and programs like google earth , members of the trio tribe , who live in the rainforests of southern suriname , map out their ancestral lands to help strengthen their territorial claims . currently , most tribes in the amazon do not have clearly defined boundaries , making it easier for commercial ventures to target their territories .	31	67
to accurately map the amazon 's biomass and subsequent carbon related emissions , the classification of tree growth stages within different parts of the forest is crucial . in 2006 tatiana kuplich organized the trees of the amazon into four categories : ( 1 ) mature forest , ( 2 ) regenerating forest [ less than three years ] , ( 3 ) regenerating forest [ between three and five years of regrowth ] , and ( 4 ) regenerating forest [ eleven to eighteen years of continued development ] . the researcher used a combination of synthetic aperture radar ( sar ) and thematic mapper ( tm ) to accurately place the different portions of the amazon into one of the four classifications .	91	124

in 2005 , parts of the amazon basin experienced the worst drought in one hundred years , and there were indications that 2006 could have been a second successive year of drought . a july 23 , 2006 article in the uk newspaper the independent reported woods hole research center results showing that the forest in its present form could survive only three years of drought . scientists at the brazilian national institute of amazonian research argue in the article that this drought response , coupled with the effects of deforestation on regional climate , are pushing the rainforest towards a " tipping point " where it would irreversibly start to die . it concludes that the forest is on the brink of being turned into savanna or desert , with catastrophic consequences for the world 's climate .	33	66
in 2010 the amazon rainforest experienced another severe drought , in some ways more extreme than the 2005 drought . the affected region was approximate 1 , 160 , 000 square miles ( 3 , 000 , 000 km2 ) of rainforest , compared to 734 , 000 square miles ( 1 , 900 , 000 km2 ) in 2005 . the 2010 drought had three epicenters where vegetation died off , whereas in 2005 the drought was focused on the southwestern part . the findings were published in the journal science . in a typical year the amazon absorbs 1 . 5 gigatons of carbon dioxide ; during 2005 instead 5 gigatons were released and in 2010 8 gigatons were released .	93	122

almost all ctenophores are predators , taking prey ranging from microscopic larvae and rotifers to the adults of small crustaceans ; the exceptions are juveniles of two species , which live as parasites on the salps on which adults of their species feed . in favorable circumstances , ctenophores can eat ten times their own weight in a day . only 100 – 150 species have been validated , and possibly another 25 have not been fully described and named . the textbook examples are cydippids with egg - shaped bodies and a pair of retractable tentacles fringed with tentilla ( " little tentacles " ) that are covered with colloblasts , sticky cells that capture prey . the phylum has a wide range of body forms , including the flattened , deep - sea platyctenids , in which the adults of most species lack combs , and the coastal beroids , which lack tentacles and prey on other ctenophores by using huge mouths armed with groups of large , stiffened cilia that act as teeth . these variations enable different species to build huge populations in the same area , because they specialize in different types of prey , which they capture by as wide a range of methods as spiders use .	44	59

ctenophores form an animal phylum that is more complex than sponges , about as complex as cnidarians ( jellyfish , sea anemones , etc . ) , and less complex than bilaterians ( which include almost all other animals ) . unlike sponges , both ctenophores and cnidarians have : cells bound by inter - cell connections and carpet - like basement membranes ; muscles ; nervous systems ; and some have sensory organs . ctenophores are distinguished from all other animals by having colloblasts , which are sticky and adhere to prey , although a few ctenophore species lack them .	75	101

like sponges and cnidarians , ctenophores have two main layers of cells that sandwich a middle layer of jelly - like material , which is called the mesoglea in cnidarians and ctenophores ; more complex animals have three main cell layers and no intermediate jelly - like layer . hence ctenophores and cnidarians have traditionally been labelled diploblastic , along with sponges . both ctenophores and cnidarians have a type of muscle that , in more complex animals , arises from the middle cell layer , and as a result some recent text books classify ctenophores as triploblastic , while others still regard them as diploblastic .	0	48
ranging from about 1 millimeter ( 0 . 039 in ) to 1 . 5 meters ( 4 . 9 ft ) in size , ctenophores are the largest non - colonial animals that use cilia ( " hairs " ) as their main method of locomotion . most species have eight strips , called comb rows , that run the length of their bodies and bear comb - like bands of cilia , called " ctenes , " stacked along the comb rows so that when the cilia beat , those of each comb touch the comb below . the name " ctenophora " means " comb - bearing " , from the greek κτεις ( stem - form κτεν - ) meaning " comb " and the greek suffix - φορος meaning " carrying " .	0	47
for a phylum with relatively few species , ctenophores have a wide range of body plans . coastal species need to be tough enough to withstand waves and swirling sediment particles , while some oceanic species are so fragile that it is very difficult to capture them intact for study . in addition oceanic species do not preserve well , and are known mainly from photographs and from observers ' notes . hence most attention has until recently concentrated on three coastal genera – pleurobrachia , beroe and mnemiopsis . at least two textbooks base their descriptions of ctenophores on the cydippid pleurobrachia .	72	89
the outer surface bears usually eight comb rows , called swimming - plates , which are used for swimming . the rows are oriented to run from near the mouth ( the " oral pole " ) to the opposite end ( the " aboral pole " ) , and are spaced more or less evenly around the body , although spacing patterns vary by species and in most species the comb rows extend only part of the distance from the aboral pole towards the mouth . the " combs " ( also called " ctenes " or " comb plates " ) run across each row , and each consists of thousands of unusually long cilia , up to 2 millimeters ( 0 . 079 in ) . unlike conventional cilia and flagella , which has a filament structure arranged in a 9 + 2 pattern , these cilia are arranged in a 9 + 3 pattern , where the extra compact filament is suspected to have a supporting function . these normally beat so that the propulsion stroke is away from the mouth , although they can also reverse direction . hence ctenophores usually swim in the direction in which the mouth is pointing , unlike jellyfish . when trying to escape predators , one species can accelerate to six times its normal speed ; some other species reverse direction as part of their escape behavior , by reversing the power stroke of the comb plate cilia .	0	19
it is uncertain how ctenophores control their buoyancy , but experiments have shown that some species rely on osmotic pressure to adapt to water of different densities . their body fluids are normally as concentrated as seawater . if they enter less dense brackish water , the ciliary rosettes in the body cavity may pump this into the mesoglea to increase its bulk and decrease its density , to avoid sinking . conversely if they move from brackish to full - strength seawater , the rosettes may pump water out of the mesoglea to reduce its volume and increase its density .	0	27
the largest single sensory feature is the aboral organ ( at the opposite end from the mouth ) . its main component is a statocyst , a balance sensor consisting of a statolith , a solid particle supported on four bundles of cilia , called " balancers " , that sense its orientation . the statocyst is protected by a transparent dome made of long , immobile cilia . a ctenophore does not automatically try to keep the statolith resting equally on all the balancers . instead its response is determined by the animal 's " mood " , in other words the overall state of the nervous system . for example , if a ctenophore with trailing tentacles captures prey , it will often put some comb rows into reverse , spinning the mouth towards the prey .	0	18
cydippid ctenophores have bodies that are more or less rounded , sometimes nearly spherical and other times more cylindrical or egg - shaped ; the common coastal " sea gooseberry , " pleurobrachia , sometimes has an egg - shaped body with the mouth at the narrow end , although some individuals are more uniformly round . from opposite sides of the body extends a pair of long , slender tentacles , each housed in a sheath into which it can be withdrawn . some species of cydippids have bodies that are flattened to various extents , so that they are wider in the plane of the tentacles .	57	83
the tentacles of cydippid ctenophores are typically fringed with tentilla ( " little tentacles " ) , although a few genera have simple tentacles without these sidebranches . the tentacles and tentilla are densely covered with microscopic colloblasts that capture prey by sticking to it . colloblasts are specialized mushroom - shaped cells in the outer layer of the epidermis , and have three main components : a domed head with vesicles ( chambers ) that contain adhesive ; a stalk that anchors the cell in the lower layer of the epidermis or in the mesoglea ; and a spiral thread that coils round the stalk and is attached to the head and to the root of the stalk . the function of the spiral thread is uncertain , but it may absorb stress when prey tries to escape , and thus prevent the collobast from being torn apart . in addition to colloblasts , members of the genus haeckelia , which feed mainly on jellyfish , incorporate their victims ' stinging nematocytes into their own tentacles – some cnidaria - eating nudibranchs similarly incorporate nematocytes into their bodies for defense . the tentilla of euplokamis differ significantly from those of other cydippids : they contain striated muscle , a cell type otherwise unknown in the phylum ctenophora ; and they are coiled when relaxed , while the tentilla of all other known ctenophores elongate when relaxed . euplokamis ' tentilla have three types of movement that are used in capturing prey : they may flick out very quickly ( in 40 to 60 milliseconds ) ; they can wriggle , which may lure prey by behaving like small planktonic worms ; and they coil round prey . the unique flicking is an uncoiling movement powered by contraction of the striated muscle . the wriggling motion is produced by smooth muscles , but of a highly specialized type . coiling around prey is accomplished largely by the return of the tentilla to their inactive state , but the coils may be tightened by smooth muscle .	0	27
there are eight rows of combs that run from near the mouth to the opposite end , and are spaced evenly round the body . the " combs " beat in a metachronal rhythm rather like that of a mexican wave . from each balancer in the statocyst a ciliary groove runs out under the dome and then splits to connect with two adjacent comb rows , and in some species runs all the way along the comb rows . this forms a mechanical system for transmitting the beat rhythm from the combs to the balancers , via water disturbances created by the cilia .	0	24

the lobata have a pair of lobes , which are muscular , cuplike extensions of the body that project beyond the mouth . their inconspicuous tentacles originate from the corners of the mouth , running in convoluted grooves and spreading out over the inner surface of the lobes ( rather than trailing far behind , as in the cydippida ) . between the lobes on either side of the mouth , many species of lobates have four auricles , gelatinous projections edged with cilia that produce water currents that help direct microscopic prey toward the mouth . this combination of structures enables lobates to feed continuously on suspended planktonic prey .	61	96
lobates have eight comb - rows , originating at the aboral pole and usually not extending beyond the body to the lobes ; in species with ( four ) auricles , the cilia edging the auricles are extensions of cilia in four of the comb rows . most lobates are quite passive when moving through the water , using the cilia on their comb rows for propulsion , although leucothea has long and active auricles whose movements also contribute to propulsion . members of the lobate genera bathocyroe and ocyropsis can escape from danger by clapping their lobes , so that the jet of expelled water drives them backwards very quickly . unlike cydippids , the movements of lobates ' combs are coordinated by nerves rather than by water disturbances created by the cilia , yet combs on the same row beat in the same mexican wave style as the mechanically coordinated comb rows of cydippids and beroids . this may have enabled lobates to grow larger than cydippids and to have shapes that are less egg - like .	82	111
the beroida , also known as nuda , have no feeding appendages , but their large pharynx , just inside the large mouth and filling most of the saclike body , bears " macrocilia " at the oral end . these fused bundles of several thousand large cilia are able to " bite " off pieces of prey that are too large to swallow whole – almost always other ctenophores . in front of the field of macrocilia , on the mouth " lips " in some species of beroe , is a pair of narrow strips of adhesive epithelial cells on the stomach wall that " zip " the mouth shut when the animal is not feeding , by forming intercellular connections with the opposite adhesive strip . this tight closure streamlines the front of the animal when it is pursuing prey .	71	128

the cestida ( " belt animals " ) are ribbon - shaped planktonic animals , with the mouth and aboral organ aligned in the middle of opposite edges of the ribbon . there is a pair of comb - rows along each aboral edge , and tentilla emerging from a groove all along the oral edge , which stream back across most of the wing - like body surface . cestids can swim by undulating their bodies as well as by the beating of their comb - rows . there are two known species , with worldwide distribution in warm , and warm - temperate waters : cestum veneris ( " venus ' girdle " ) is among the largest ctenophores – up to 1 . 5 meters ( 4 . 9 ft ) long , and can undulate slowly or quite rapidly . velamen parallelum , which is typically less than 20 centimeters ( 0 . 66 ft ) long , can move much faster in what has been described as a " darting motion " .	89	143
most platyctenida have oval bodies that are flattened in the oral - aboral direction , with a pair of tentilla - bearing tentacles on the aboral surface . they cling to and creep on surfaces by everting the pharynx and using it as a muscular " foot " . all but one of the known platyctenid species lack comb - rows . platyctenids are usually cryptically colored , live on rocks , algae , or the body surfaces of other invertebrates , and are often revealed by their long tentacles with many sidebranches , seen streaming off the back of the ctenophore into the current .	49	61

development of the fertilized eggs is direct , in other words there is no distinctive larval form , and juveniles of all groups generally resemble miniature cydippid adults . in the genus beroe the juveniles , like the adults , lack tentacles and tentacle sheaths . in most species the juveniles gradually develop the body forms of their parents . in some groups , such as the flat , bottom - dwelling platyctenids , the juveniles behave more like true larvae , as they live among the plankton and thus occupy a different ecological niche from their parents and attain the adult form by a more radical metamorphosis , after dropping to the sea - floor .	29	45

almost all ctenophores are predators – there are no vegetarians and only one genus that is partly parasitic . if food is plentiful , they can eat 10 times their own weight per day . while beroe preys mainly on other ctenophores , other surface - water species prey on zooplankton ( planktonic animals ) ranging in size from the microscopic , including mollusc and fish larvae , to small adult crustaceans such as copepods , amphipods , and even krill . members of the genus haeckelia prey on jellyfish and incorporate their prey 's nematocysts ( stinging cells ) into their own tentacles instead of colloblasts . ctenophores have been compared to spiders in their wide range of techniques from capturing prey – some hang motionless in the water using their tentacles as " webs " , some are ambush predators like salticid jumping spiders , and some dangle a sticky droplet at the end of a fine thread , as bolas spiders do . this variety explains the wide range of body forms in a phylum with rather few species . the two - tentacled " cydippid " lampea feeds exclusively on salps , close relatives of sea - squirts that form large chain - like floating colonies , and juveniles of lampea attach themselves like parasites to salps that are too large for them to swallow . members of the cydippid genus pleurobrachia and the lobate bolinopsis often reach high population densities at the same place and time because they specialize in different types of prey : pleurobrachia 's long tentacles mainly capture relatively strong swimmers such as adult copepods , while bolinopsis generally feeds on smaller , weaker swimmers such as rotifers and mollusc and crustacean larvae .	239	291
on the other hand , in the late 1980s the western atlantic ctenophore mnemiopsis leidyi was accidentally introduced into the black sea and sea of azov via the ballast tanks of ships , and has been blamed for causing sharp drops in fish catches by eating both fish larvae and small crustaceans that would otherwise feed the adult fish . mnemiopsis is well equipped to invade new territories ( although this was not predicted until after it so successfully colonized the black sea ) , as it can breed very rapidly and tolerate a wide range of water temperatures and salinities . the impact was increased by chronic overfishing , and by eutrophication that gave the entire ecosystem a short - term boost , causing the mnemiopsis population to increase even faster than normal – and above all by the absence of efficient predators on these introduced ctenophores . mnemiopsis populations in those areas were eventually brought under control by the accidental introduction of the mnemiopsis - eating north american ctenophore beroe ovata , and by a cooling of the local climate from 1991 to 1993 , which significantly slowed the animal 's metabolism . however the abundance of plankton in the area seems unlikely to be restored to pre - mnemiopsis levels .	0	59

because of their soft , gelatinous bodies , ctenophores are extremely rare as fossils , and fossils that have been interpreted as ctenophores have been found only in lagerstatten , places where the environment was exceptionally suited to preservation of soft tissue . until the mid - 1990s only two specimens good enough for analysis were known , both members of the crown group , from the early devonian ( emsian ) period . three additional putative species were then found in the burgess shale and other canadian rocks of similar age , about 505 million years ago in the mid - cambrian period . all three apparently lacked tentacles but had between 24 and 80 comb rows , far more than the 8 typical of living species . they also appear to have had internal organ - like structures unlike anything found in living ctenophores . one of the fossil species first reported in 1996 had a large mouth , apparently surrounded by a folded edge that may have been muscular . evidence from china a year later suggests that such ctenophores were widespread in the cambrian , but perhaps very different from modern species – for example one fossil 's comb - rows were mounted on prominent vanes . the ediacaran eoandromeda could putatively represent a comb jelly .	74	104

in connectionless mode each packet includes complete addressing information . the packets are routed individually , sometimes resulting in different paths and out - of - order delivery . each packet is labeled with a destination address , source address , and port numbers . it may also be labeled with the sequence number of the packet . this precludes the need for a dedicated path to help the packet find its way to its destination , but means that much more information is needed in the packet header , which is therefore larger , and this information needs to be looked up in power - hungry content - addressable memory . each packet is dispatched and may go via different routes ; potentially , the system has to do as much work for every packet as the connection - oriented system has to do in connection set - up , but with less information as to the application 's requirements . at the destination , the original message / data is reassembled in the correct order , based on the packet sequence number . thus a virtual connection , also known as a virtual circuit or byte stream is provided to the end - user by a transport layer protocol , although intermediate network nodes only provides a connectionless network layer service .	0	9
both x . 25 and frame relay provide connection - oriented operations . but x . 25 does it at the network layer of the osi model . frame relay does it at level two , the data link layer . another major difference between x . 25 and frame relay is that x . 25 requires a handshake between the communicating parties before any user packets are transmitted . frame relay does not define any such handshakes . x . 25 does not define any operations inside the packet network . it only operates at the user - network - interface ( uni ) . thus , the network provider is free to use any procedure it wishes inside the network . x . 25 does specify some limited re - transmission procedures at the uni , and its link layer protocol ( lapb ) provides conventional hdlc - type link management procedures . frame relay is a modified version of isdn 's layer two protocol , lapd and lapb . as such , its integrity operations pertain only between nodes on a link , not end - to - end . any retransmissions must be carried out by higher layer protocols . the x . 25 uni protocol is part of the x . 25 protocol suite , which consists of the lower three layers of the osi model . it was widely used at the uni for packet switching networks during the 1980s and early 1990s , to provide a standardized interface into and out of packet networks . some implementations used x . 25 within the network as well , but its connection - oriented features made this setup cumbersome and inefficient . frame relay operates principally at layer two of the osi model . however , its address field ( the data link connection id , or dlci ) can be used at the osi network layer , with a minimum set of procedures . thus , it rids itself of many x . 25 layer 3 encumbrances , but still has the dlci as an id beyond a node - to - node layer two link protocol . the simplicity of frame relay makes it faster and more efficient than x . 25 . because frame relay is a data link layer protocol , like x . 25 it does not define internal network routing operations . for x . 25 its packet ids - - - the virtual circuit and virtual channel numbers have to be correlated to network addresses . the same is true for frame relays dlci . how this is done is up to the network provider . frame relay , by virtue of having no network layer procedures is connection - oriented at layer two , by using the hdlc / lapd / lapb set asynchronous balanced mode ( sabm ) . x . 25 connections are typically established for each communication session , but it does have a feature allowing a limited amount of traffic to be passed across the uni without the connection - oriented handshake . for a while , frame relay was used to interconnect lans across wide area networks . however , x . 25 and well as frame relay have been supplanted by the internet protocol ( ip ) at the network layer , and the asynchronous transfer mode ( atm ) and or versions of multi - protocol label switching ( mpls ) at layer two . a typical configuration is to run ip over atm or a version of mpls . < uyless black , x . 25 and related protocols , ieee computer society , 1991 > < uyless black , frame relay networks , mcgraw - hill , 1998 > < uyless black , mpls and label switching networks , prentice hall , 2001 > < uyless black , atm , volume i , prentice hall , 1995 >	0	12
arpanet and sita hln became operational in 1969 . before the introduction of x . 25 in 1973 , about twenty different network technologies had been developed . two fundamental differences involved the division of functions and tasks between the hosts at the edge of the network and the network core . in the datagram system , the hosts have the responsibility to ensure orderly delivery of packets . the user datagram protocol ( udp ) is an example of a datagram protocol . in the virtual call system , the network guarantees sequenced delivery of data to the host . this results in a simpler host interface with less functionality than in the datagram model . the x . 25 protocol suite uses this network type .	101	116

( in addition to selling ge computers , the centers were computer service bureaus , offering batch processing services . they lost money from the beginning , and sinback , a high - level marketing manager , was given the job of turning the business around . he decided that a time - sharing system , based on kemney 's work at dartmouth — which used a computer on loan from ge — could be profitable . warner was right . )	0	59
telenet was the first fcc - licensed public data network in the united states . it was founded by former arpa ipto director larry roberts as a means of making arpanet technology public . he had tried to interest at & t in buying the technology , but the monopoly 's reaction was that this was incompatible with their future . bolt , beranack and newman ( bbn ) provided the financing . it initially used arpanet technology but changed the host interface to x . 25 and the terminal interface to x . 29 . telenet designed these protocols and helped standardize them in the ccitt . telenet was incorporated in 1973 and started operations in 1975 . it went public in 1979 and was then sold to gte .	73	95

the black death is thought to have originated in the arid plains of central asia , where it then travelled along the silk road , reaching crimea by 1343 . from there , it was most likely carried by oriental rat fleas living on the black rats that were regular passengers on merchant ships . spreading throughout the mediterranean and europe , the black death is estimated to have killed 30 – 60 % of europe 's total population . in total , the plague reduced the world population from an estimated 450 million down to 350 – 375 million in the 14th century . the world population as a whole did not recover to pre - plague levels until the 17th century . the plague recurred occasionally in europe until the 19th century .	55	79
the plague disease , caused by yersinia pestis , is enzootic ( commonly present ) in populations of fleas carried by ground rodents , including marmots , in various areas including central asia , kurdistan , western asia , northern india and uganda . nestorian graves dating to 1338 – 39 near lake issyk kul in kyrgyzstan have inscriptions referring to plague and are thought by many epidemiologists to mark the outbreak of the epidemic , from which it could easily have spread to china and india . in october 2010 , medical geneticists suggested that all three of the great waves of the plague originated in china . in china , the 13th century mongol conquest caused a decline in farming and trading . however , economic recovery had been observed at the beginning of the 14th century . in the 1330s a large number of natural disasters and plagues led to widespread famine , starting in 1331 , with a deadly plague arriving soon after . epidemics that may have included plague killed an estimated 25 million chinese and other asians during the 15 years before it reached constantinople in 1347 .	140	167

plague was reportedly first introduced to europe via genoese traders at the port city of kaffa in the crimea in 1347 . after a protracted siege , during which the mongol army under jani beg was suffering from the disease , the army catapulted the infected corpses over the city walls of kaffa to infect the inhabitants . the genoese traders fled , taking the plague by ship into sicily and the south of europe , whence it spread north . whether or not this hypothesis is accurate , it is clear that several existing conditions such as war , famine , and weather contributed to the severity of the black death .	22	57
the plague struck various countries in the middle east during the pandemic , leading to serious depopulation and permanent change in both economic and social structures . as it spread to western europe , the disease entered the region from southern russia also . by autumn 1347 , the plague reached alexandria in egypt , probably through the port 's trade with constantinople , and ports on the black sea . during 1347 , the disease travelled eastward to gaza , and north along the eastern coast to cities in lebanon , syria and palestine , including ashkelon , acre , jerusalem , sidon , damascus , homs , and aleppo . in 1348 – 49 , the disease reached antioch . the city 's residents fled to the north , most of them dying during the journey , but the infection had been spread to the people of asia minor .

gasquet ( 1908 ) claimed that the latin name atra mors ( black death ) for the 14th - century epidemic first appeared in modern times in 1631 in a book on danish history by j . i . pontanus : " vulgo & ab effectu atram mortem vocatibant . ( " commonly and from its effects , they called it the black death " ) . the name spread through scandinavia and then germany , gradually becoming attached to the mid 14th - century epidemic as a proper name . in england , it was not until 1823 that the medieval epidemic was first called the black death .	0	49
medical knowledge had stagnated during the middle ages . the most authoritative account at the time came from the medical faculty in paris in a report to the king of france that blamed the heavens , in the form of a conjunction of three planets in 1345 that caused a " great pestilence in the air " . this report became the first and most widely circulated of a series of plague tracts that sought to give advice to sufferers . that the plague was caused by bad air became the most widely accepted theory . today , this is known as the miasma theory . the word ' plague ' had no special significance at this time , and only the recurrence of outbreaks during the middle ages gave it the name that has become the medical term .	81	95
other forms of plague have been implicated by modern scientists . the modern bubonic plague has a mortality rate of 30 – 75 % and symptoms including fever of 38 – 41 ° c ( 100 – 106 ° f ) , headaches , painful aching joints , nausea and vomiting , and a general feeling of malaise . left untreated , of those that contract the bubonic plague , 80 percent die within eight days . pneumonic plague has a mortality rate of 90 to 95 percent . symptoms include fever , cough , and blood - tinged sputum . as the disease progresses , sputum becomes free flowing and bright red . septicemic plague is the least common of the three forms , with a mortality rate near 100 % . symptoms are high fevers and purple skin patches ( purpura due to disseminated intravascular coagulation ) . in cases of pneumonic and particularly septicemic plague , the progress of the disease is so rapid that there would often be no time for the development of the enlarged lymph nodes that were noted as buboes .	11	58
the study also found that there were two previously unknown but related clades ( genetic branches ) of the y . pestis genome associated with medieval mass graves . these clades ( which are thought to be extinct ) were found to be ancestral to modern isolates of the modern y . pestis strains y . p . orientalis and y . p . medievalis , suggesting the plague may have entered europe in two waves . surveys of plague pit remains in france and england indicate the first variant entered europe through the port of marseille around november 1347 and spread through france over the next two years , eventually reaching england in the spring of 1349 , where it spread through the country in three epidemics . surveys of plague pit remains from the dutch town of bergen op zoom showed the y . pestis genotype responsible for the pandemic that spread through the low countries from 1350 differed from that found in britain and france , implying bergen op zoom ( and possibly other parts of the southern netherlands ) was not directly infected from england or france in 1349 and suggesting a second wave of plague , different from those in britain and france , may have been carried to the low countries from norway , the hanseatic cities or another site .	77	128
the plague theory was first significantly challenged by the work of british bacteriologist j . f . d . shrewsbury in 1970 , who noted that the reported rates of mortality in rural areas during the 14th - century pandemic were inconsistent with the modern bubonic plague , leading him to conclude that contemporary accounts were exaggerations . in 1984 zoologist graham twigg produced the first major work to challenge the bubonic plague theory directly , and his doubts about the identity of the black death have been taken up by a number of authors , including samuel k . cohn , jr . ( 2002 ) , david herlihy ( 1997 ) , and susan scott and christopher duncan ( 2001 ) .	0	57
it is recognised that an epidemiological account of the plague is as important as an identification of symptoms , but researchers are hampered by the lack of reliable statistics from this period . most work has been done on the spread of the plague in england , and even estimates of overall population at the start vary by over 100 % as no census was undertaken between the time of publication of the domesday book and the year 1377 . estimates of plague victims are usually extrapolated from figures from the clergy .	33	79
in addition to arguing that the rat population was insufficient to account for a bubonic plague pandemic , sceptics of the bubonic plague theory point out that the symptoms of the black death are not unique ( and arguably in some accounts may differ from bubonic plague ) ; that transference via fleas in goods was likely to be of marginal significance ; and that the dna results may be flawed and might not have been repeated elsewhere , despite extensive samples from other mass graves . other arguments include the lack of accounts of the death of rats before outbreaks of plague between the 14th and 17th centuries ; temperatures that are too cold in northern europe for the survival of fleas ; that , despite primitive transport systems , the spread of the black death was much faster than that of modern bubonic plague ; that mortality rates of the black death appear to be very high ; that , while modern bubonic plague is largely endemic as a rural disease , the black death indiscriminately struck urban and rural areas ; and that the pattern of the black death , with major outbreaks in the same areas separated by 5 to 15 years , differs from modern bubonic plague — which often becomes endemic for decades with annual flare - ups .	87	224
the most widely accepted estimate for the middle east , including iraq , iran and syria , during this time , is for a death rate of about a third . the black death killed about 40 % of egypt 's population . half of paris 's population of 100 , 000 people died . in italy , the population of florence was reduced from 110 – 120 thousand inhabitants in 1338 down to 50 thousand in 1351 . at least 60 % of the population of hamburg and bremen perished , and a similar percentage of londoners may have died from the disease as well . interestingly while contemporary reports account of mass burial pits being created in response to the large numbers of dead , recent scientific investigations of a burial pit in central london found well - preserved individuals to be buried in isolated , evenly spaced graves , suggesting at least some pre - planning and christian burials at this time . before 1350 , there were about 170 , 000 settlements in germany , and this was reduced by nearly 40 , 000 by 1450 . in 1348 , the plague spread so rapidly that before any physicians or government authorities had time to reflect upon its origins , about a third of the european population had already perished . in crowded cities , it was not uncommon for as much as 50 % of the population to die . the disease bypassed some areas , and the most isolated areas were less vulnerable to contagion . monks and priests were especially hard hit since they cared for victims of the black death .	43	54
in 1466 , perhaps 40 , 000 people died of the plague in paris . during the 16th and 17th centuries , the plague was present in paris around 30 per cent of the time . the black death ravaged europe for three years before it continued on into russia , where the disease was present somewhere in the country 25 times between 1350 to 1490 . plague epidemics ravaged london in 1563 , 1593 , 1603 , 1625 , 1636 , and 1665 , reducing its population by 10 to 30 % during those years . over 10 % of amsterdam 's population died in 1623 – 25 , and again in 1635 – 36 , 1655 , and 1664 . plague occurred in venice 22 times between 1361 and 1528 . the plague of 1576 – 77 killed 50 , 000 in venice , almost a third of the population . late outbreaks in central europe included the italian plague of 1629 – 1631 , which is associated with troop movements during the thirty years ' war , and the great plague of vienna in 1679 . over 60 % of norway 's population died in 1348 – 50 . the last plague outbreak ravaged oslo in 1654 .	36	66

the black death ravaged much of the islamic world . plague was present in at least one location in the islamic world virtually every year between 1500 and 1850 . plague repeatedly struck the cities of north africa . algiers lost 30 to 50 thousand inhabitants to it in 1620 – 21 , and again in 1654 – 57 , 1665 , 1691 , and 1740 – 42 . plague remained a major event in ottoman society until the second quarter of the 19th century . between 1701 and 1750 , thirty - seven larger and smaller epidemics were recorded in constantinople , and an additional thirty - one between 1751 and 1800 . baghdad has suffered severely from visitations of the plague , and sometimes two - thirds of its population has been wiped out .	39	68
there are three major types of rock : igneous , sedimentary , and metamorphic . the rock cycle is an important concept in geology which illustrates the relationships between these three types of rock , and magma . when a rock crystallizes from melt ( magma and / or lava ) , it is an igneous rock . this rock can be weathered and eroded , and then redeposited and lithified into a sedimentary rock , or be turned into a metamorphic rock due to heat and pressure that change the mineral content of the rock which gives it a characteristic fabric . the sedimentary rock can then be subsequently turned into a metamorphic rock due to heat and pressure and is then weathered , eroded , deposited , and lithified , ultimately becoming a sedimentary rock . sedimentary rock may also be re - eroded and redeposited , and metamorphic rock may also undergo additional metamorphism . all three types of rocks may be re - melted ; when this happens , a new magma is formed , from which an igneous rock may once again crystallize .	0	14

in the 1960s , a series of discoveries , the most important of which was seafloor spreading , showed that the earth 's lithosphere , which includes the crust and rigid uppermost portion of the upper mantle , is separated into a number of tectonic plates that move across the plastically deforming , solid , upper mantle , which is called the asthenosphere . there is an intimate coupling between the movement of the plates on the surface and the convection of the mantle : oceanic plate motions and mantle convection currents always move in the same direction , because the oceanic lithosphere is the rigid upper thermal boundary layer of the convecting mantle . this coupling between rigid plates moving on the surface of the earth and the convecting mantle is called plate tectonics .	0	63

the development of plate tectonics provided a physical basis for many observations of the solid earth . long linear regions of geologic features could be explained as plate boundaries . mid - ocean ridges , high regions on the seafloor where hydrothermal vents and volcanoes exist , were explained as divergent boundaries , where two plates move apart . arcs of volcanoes and earthquakes were explained as convergent boundaries , where one plate subducts under another . transform boundaries , such as the san andreas fault system , resulted in widespread powerful earthquakes . plate tectonics also provided a mechanism for alfred wegener 's theory of continental drift , in which the continents move across the surface of the earth over geologic time . they also provided a driving force for crustal deformation , and a new setting for the observations of structural geology . the power of the theory of plate tectonics lies in its ability to combine all of these observations into a single theory of how the lithosphere moves over the convecting mantle .	94	123
seismologists can use the arrival times of seismic waves in reverse to image the interior of the earth . early advances in this field showed the existence of a liquid outer core ( where shear waves were not able to propagate ) and a dense solid inner core . these advances led to the development of a layered model of the earth , with a crust and lithosphere on top , the mantle below ( separated within itself by seismic discontinuities at 410 and 660 kilometers ) , and the outer core and inner core below that . more recently , seismologists have been able to create detailed images of wave speeds inside the earth in the same way a doctor images a body in a ct scan . these images have led to a much more detailed view of the interior of the earth , and have replaced the simplified layered model with a much more dynamic model .	49	97
the following four timelines show the geologic time scale . the first shows the entire time from the formation of the earth to the present , but this compresses the most recent eon . therefore , the second scale shows the most recent eon with an expanded scale . the second scale compresses the most recent era , so the most recent era is expanded in the third scale . since the quaternary is a very short period with short epochs , it is further expanded in the fourth scale . the second , third , and fourth timelines are therefore each subsections of their preceding timeline as indicated by asterisks . the holocene ( the latest epoch ) is too small to be shown clearly on the third timeline on the right , another reason for expanding the fourth scale . the pleistocene ( p ) epoch . q stands for the quaternary period .	112	141
the principle of cross - cutting relationships pertains to the formation of faults and the age of the sequences through which they cut . faults are younger than the rocks they cut ; accordingly , if a fault is found that penetrates some formations but not those on top of it , then the formations that were cut are older than the fault , and the ones that are not cut must be younger than the fault . finding the key bed in these situations may help determine whether the fault is a normal fault or a thrust fault .	0	23

the principle of inclusions and components states that , with sedimentary rocks , if inclusions ( or clasts ) are found in a formation , then the inclusions must be older than the formation that contains them . for example , in sedimentary rocks , it is common for gravel from an older formation to be ripped up and included in a newer layer . a similar situation with igneous rocks occurs when xenoliths are found . these foreign bodies are picked up as magma or lava flows , and are incorporated , later to cool in the matrix . as a result , xenoliths are older than the rock which contains them .	0	37

the principle of faunal succession is based on the appearance of fossils in sedimentary rocks . as organisms exist at the same time period throughout the world , their presence or ( sometimes ) absence may be used to provide a relative age of the formations in which they are found . based on principles laid out by william smith almost a hundred years before the publication of charles darwin 's theory of evolution , the principles of succession were developed independently of evolutionary thought . the principle becomes quite complex , however , given the uncertainties of fossilization , the localization of fossil types due to lateral changes in habitat ( facies change in sedimentary strata ) , and that not all fossils may be found globally at the same time .	52	85
at the beginning of the 20th century , important advancement in geological science was facilitated by the ability to obtain accurate absolute dates to geologic events using radioactive isotopes and other methods . this changed the understanding of geologic time . previously , geologists could only use fossils and stratigraphic correlation to date sections of rock relative to one another . with isotopic dates it became possible to assign absolute ages to rock units , and these absolute dates could be applied to fossil sequences in which there was datable material , converting the old relative ages into new absolute ages .	0	32

for many geologic applications , isotope ratios of radioactive elements are measured in minerals that give the amount of time that has passed since a rock passed through its particular closure temperature , the point at which different radiometric isotopes stop diffusing into and out of the crystal lattice . these are used in geochronologic and thermochronologic studies . common methods include uranium - lead dating , potassium - argon dating , argon - argon dating and uranium - thorium dating . these methods are used for a variety of applications . dating of lava and volcanic ash layers found within a stratigraphic sequence can provide absolute age data for sedimentary rock units which do not contain radioactive isotopes and calibrate relative dating techniques . these methods can also be used to determine ages of pluton emplacement . thermochemical techniques can be used to determine temperature profiles within the crust , the uplift of mountain ranges , and paleotopography .	0	49
when rock units are placed under horizontal compression , they shorten and become thicker . because rock units , other than muds , do not significantly change in volume , this is accomplished in two primary ways : through faulting and folding . in the shallow crust , where brittle deformation can occur , thrust faults form , which cause deeper rock to move on top of shallower rock . because deeper rock is often older , as noted by the principle of superposition , this can result in older rocks moving on top of younger ones . movement along faults can result in folding , either because the faults are not planar or because rock layers are dragged along , forming drag folds as slip occurs along the fault . deeper in the earth , rocks behave plastically , and fold instead of faulting . these folds can either be those where the material in the center of the fold buckles upwards , creating " antiforms " , or where it buckles downwards , creating " synforms " . if the tops of the rock units within the folds remain pointing upwards , they are called anticlines and synclines , respectively . if some of the units in the fold are facing downward , the structure is called an overturned anticline or syncline , and if all of the rock units are overturned or the correct up - direction is unknown , they are simply called by the most general terms , antiforms and synforms .	146	179
extension causes the rock units as a whole to become longer and thinner . this is primarily accomplished through normal faulting and through the ductile stretching and thinning . normal faults drop rock units that are higher below those that are lower . this typically results in younger units being placed below older units . stretching of units can result in their thinning ; in fact , there is a location within the maria fold and thrust belt in which the entire sedimentary sequence of the grand canyon can be seen over a length of less than a meter . rocks at the depth to be ductilely stretched are often also metamorphosed . these stretched rocks can also pinch into lenses , known as boudins , after the french word for " sausage " , because of their visual similarity .	113	140
the addition of new rock units , both depositionally and intrusively , often occurs during deformation . faulting and other deformational processes result in the creation of topographic gradients , causing material on the rock unit that is increasing in elevation to be eroded by hillslopes and channels . these sediments are deposited on the rock unit that is going down . continual motion along the fault maintains the topographic gradient in spite of the movement of sediment , and continues to create accommodation space for the material to deposit . deformational events are often also associated with volcanism and igneous activity . volcanic ashes and lavas accumulate on the surface , and igneous intrusions enter from below . dikes , long , planar igneous intrusions , enter along cracks , and therefore often form in large numbers in areas that are being actively deformed . this can result in the emplacement of dike swarms , such as those that are observable across the canadian shield , or rings of dikes around the lava tube of a volcano .	91	102

all of these processes do not necessarily occur in a single environment , and do not necessarily occur in a single order . the hawaiian islands , for example , consist almost entirely of layered basaltic lava flows . the sedimentary sequences of the mid - continental united states and the grand canyon in the southwestern united states contain almost - undeformed stacks of sedimentary rocks that have remained in place since cambrian time . other areas are much more geologically complex . in the southwestern united states , sedimentary , volcanic , and intrusive rocks have been metamorphosed , faulted , foliated , and folded . even older rocks , such as the acasta gneiss of the slave craton in northwestern canada , the oldest known rock in the world have been metamorphosed to the point where their origin is undiscernable without laboratory analysis . in addition , these processes can occur in stages . in many places , the grand canyon in the southwestern united states being a very visible example , the lower rock units were metamorphosed and deformed , and then deformation ended and the upper , undeformed units were deposited . although any amount of rock emplacement and rock deformation can occur , and they can occur any number of times , these concepts provide a guide to understanding the geological history of an area .	107	145
in addition to identifying rocks in the field , petrologists identify rock samples in the laboratory . two of the primary methods for identifying rocks in the laboratory are through optical microscopy and by using an electron microprobe . in an optical mineralogy analysis , thin sections of rock samples are analyzed through a petrographic microscope , where the minerals can be identified through their different properties in plane - polarized and cross - polarized light , including their birefringence , pleochroism , twinning , and interference properties with a conoscopic lens . in the electron microprobe , individual locations are analyzed for their exact chemical compositions and variation in composition within individual crystals . stable and radioactive isotope studies provide insight into the geochemical evolution of rock units .	39	92

petrologists can also use fluid inclusion data and perform high temperature and pressure physical experiments to understand the temperatures and pressures at which different mineral phases appear , and how they change through igneous and metamorphic processes . this research can be extrapolated to the field to understand metamorphic processes and the conditions of crystallization of igneous rocks . this work can also help to explain processes that occur within the earth , such as subduction and magma chamber evolution .	0	37

among the most well - known experiments in structural geology are those involving orogenic wedges , which are zones in which mountains are built along convergent tectonic plate boundaries . in the analog versions of these experiments , horizontal layers of sand are pulled along a lower surface into a back stop , which results in realistic - looking patterns of faulting and the growth of a critically tapered ( all angles remain the same ) orogenic wedge . numerical models work in the same way as these analog models , though they are often more sophisticated and can include patterns of erosion and uplift in the mountain belt . this helps to show the relationship between erosion and the shape of the mountain range . these studies can also give useful information about pathways for metamorphism through pressure , temperature , space , and time .	0	29

in the laboratory , stratigraphers analyze samples of stratigraphic sections that can be returned from the field , such as those from drill cores . stratigraphers also analyze data from geophysical surveys that show the locations of stratigraphic units in the subsurface . geophysical data and well logs can be combined to produce a better view of the subsurface , and stratigraphers often use computer programs to do this in three dimensions . stratigraphers can then use these data to reconstruct ancient processes occurring on the surface of the earth , interpret past environments , and locate areas for water , coal , and hydrocarbon extraction .	25	42
some modern scholars , such as fielding h . garrison , are of the opinion that the origin of the science of geology can be traced to persia after the muslim conquests had come to an end . abu al - rayhan al - biruni ( 973 – 1048 ce ) was one of the earliest persian geologists , whose works included the earliest writings on the geology of india , hypothesizing that the indian subcontinent was once a sea . drawing from greek and indian scientific literature that were not destroyed by the muslim conquests , the persian scholar ibn sina ( avicenna , 981 – 1037 ) proposed detailed explanations for the formation of mountains , the origin of earthquakes , and other topics central to modern geology , which provided an essential foundation for the later development of the science . in china , the polymath shen kuo ( 1031 – 1095 ) formulated a hypothesis for the process of land formation : based on his observation of fossil animal shells in a geological stratum in a mountain hundreds of miles from the ocean , he inferred that the land was formed by erosion of the mountains and by deposition of silt .	0	37
james hutton is often viewed as the first modern geologist . in 1785 he presented a paper entitled theory of the earth to the royal society of edinburgh . in his paper , he explained his theory that the earth must be much older than had previously been supposed in order to allow enough time for mountains to be eroded and for sediments to form new rocks at the bottom of the sea , which in turn were raised up to become dry land . hutton published a two - volume version of his ideas in 1795 ( vol . 1 , vol . 2 ) .	85	106

the word pharmacy is derived from its root word pharma which was a term used since the 15th – 17th centuries . however , the original greek roots from pharmakos imply sorcery or even poison . in addition to pharma responsibilities , the pharma offered general medical advice and a range of services that are now performed solely by other specialist practitioners , such as surgery and midwifery . the pharma ( as it was referred to ) often operated through a retail shop which , in addition to ingredients for medicines , sold tobacco and patent medicines . often the place that did this was called an apothecary and several languages have this as the dominant term , though their practices are more akin to a modern pharmacy , in english the term apothecary would today be seen as outdated or only approproriate if herbal remedies were on offer to a large extent . the pharmas also used many other herbs not listed . the greek word pharmakeia ( greek : φαρμακεια ) derives from pharmakon ( φαρμακον ) , meaning " drug " , " medicine " ( or " poison " ) .

civil disobedience is usually defined as pertaining to a citizen 's relation to the state and its laws , as distinguished from a constitutional impasse in which two public agencies , especially two equally sovereign branches of government , conflict . for instance , if the head of government of a country were to refuse to enforce a decision of that country 's highest court , it would not be civil disobedience , since the head of government would be acting in her or his capacity as public official rather than private citizen .	0	40
some theories of civil disobedience hold that civil disobedience is only justified against governmental entities . brownlee argues that disobedience in opposition to the decisions of non - governmental agencies such as trade unions , banks , and private universities can be justified if it reflects " a larger challenge to the legal system that permits those decisions to be taken " . the same principle , she argues , applies to breaches of law in protest against international organizations and foreign governments .	0	15

it is usually recognized that lawbreaking , if it is not done publicly , at least must be publicly announced in order to constitute civil disobedience . but stephen eilmann argues that if it is necessary to disobey rules that conflict with morality , we might ask why disobedience should take the form of public civil disobedience rather than simply covert lawbreaking . if a lawyer wishes to help a client overcome legal obstacles to securing her or his natural rights , he might , for instance , find that assisting in fabricating evidence or committing perjury is more effective than open disobedience . this assumes that common morality does not have a prohibition on deceit in such situations . the fully informed jury association 's publication " a primer for prospective jurors " notes , " think of the dilemma faced by german citizens when hitler 's secret police demanded to know if they were hiding a jew in their house . " by this definition , civil disobedience could be traced back to the book of exodus , where shiphrah and puah refused a direct order of pharaoh but misrepresented how they did it .

it is usually recognized that lawbreaking , if it is not done publicly , at least must be publicly announced in order to constitute civil disobedience . but stephen eilmann argues that if it is necessary to disobey rules that conflict with morality , we might ask why disobedience should take the form of public civil disobedience rather than simply covert lawbreaking . if a lawyer wishes to help a client overcome legal obstacles to securing her or his natural rights , he might , for instance , find that assisting in fabricating evidence or committing perjury is more effective than open disobedience . this assumes that common morality does not have a prohibition on deceit in such situations . the fully informed jury association 's publication " a primer for prospective jurors " notes , " think of the dilemma faced by german citizens when hitler 's secret police demanded to know if they were hiding a jew in their house .

there have been debates as to whether civil disobedience must necessarily be non - violent . black 's law dictionary includes non - violence in its definition of civil disobedience . christian bay 's encyclopedia article states that civil disobedience requires " carefully chosen and legitimate means , " but holds that they do not have to be non - violent . it has been argued that , while both civil disobedience and civil rebellion are justified by appeal to constitutional defects , rebellion is much more destructive ; therefore , the defects justifying rebellion must be much more serious than those justifying disobedience , and if one can not justify civil rebellion , then one can not justify a civil disobedients ' use of force and violence and refusal to submit to arrest . civil disobedients ' refraining from violence is also said to help preserve society 's tolerance of civil disobedience .	31	61

civil disobedients have chosen a variety of different illegal acts . bedau writes , " there is a whole class of acts , undertaken in the name of civil disobedience , which , even if they were widely practiced , would in themselves constitute hardly more than a nuisance ( e . g . trespassing at a nuclear - missile installation ) . . . such acts are often just a harassment and , at least to the bystander , somewhat inane . . . the remoteness of the connection between the disobedient act and the objectionable law lays such acts open to the charge of ineffectiveness and absurdity . " bedau also notes , though , that the very harmlessness of such entirely symbolic illegal protests toward public policy goals may serve a propaganda purpose . some civil disobedients , such as the proprietors of illegal medical cannabis dispensaries and voice in the wilderness , which brought medicine to iraq without the permission of the u . s . government , directly achieve a desired social goal ( such as the provision of medication to the sick ) while openly breaking the law . julia butterfly hill lived in luna , a 180 - foot ( 55 m ) - tall , 600 - year - old california redwood tree for 738 days , successfully preventing it from being cut down .	11	80

in cases where the criminalized behavior is pure speech , civil disobedience can consist simply of engaging in the forbidden speech . an example would be wbai 's broadcasting the track " filthy words " from a george carlin comedy album , which eventually led to the 1978 supreme court case of fcc v . pacifica foundation . threatening government officials is another classic way of expressing defiance toward the government and unwillingness to stand for its policies . for example , joseph haas was arrested for allegedly sending an email to the lebanon , new hampshire city councilors stating , " wise up or die .

some civil disobedients feel it is incumbent upon them to accept punishment because of their belief in the validity of the social contract , which is held to bind all to obey the laws that a government meeting certain standards of legitimacy has established , or else suffer the penalties set out in the law . other civil disobedients who favor the existence of government still do n't believe in the legitimacy of their particular government , or do n't believe in the legitimacy of a particular law it has enacted . and still other civil disobedients , being anarchists , do n't believe in the legitimacy of any government , and therefore see no need to accept punishment for a violation of criminal law that does not infringe the rights of others .	0	55

an important decision for civil disobedients is whether or not to plead guilty . there is much debate on this point , as some believe that it is a civil disobedient 's duty to submit to the punishment prescribed by law , while others believe that defending oneself in court will increase the possibility of changing the unjust law . it has also been argued that either choice is compatible with the spirit of civil disobedience . act - up 's civil disobedience training handbook states that a civil disobedient who pleads guilty is essentially stating , " yes , i committed the act of which you accuse me . i do n't deny it ; in fact , i am proud of it . i feel i did the right thing by violating this particular law ; i am guilty as charged , " but that pleading not guilty sends a message of , " guilt implies wrong - doing . i feel i have done no wrong . i may have violated some specific laws , but i am guilty of doing no wrong . i therefore plead not guilty . " a plea of no contest is sometimes regarded as a compromise between the two . one defendant accused of illegally protesting nuclear power , when asked to enter his plea , stated , " i plead for the beauty that surrounds us " ; this is known as a " creative plea , " and will usually be interpreted as a plea of not guilty .	14	59
when the committee for non - violent action sponsored a protest in august 1957 , at the camp mercury nuclear test site near las vegas , nevada , 13 of the protesters attempted to enter the test site knowing that they faced arrest . at a pre - arranged announced time , one at a time they stepped across the " line " and were immediately arrested . they were put on a bus and taken to the nye county seat of tonopah , nevada , and arraigned for trial before the local justice of the peace , that afternoon . a well known civil rights attorney , francis heisler , had volunteered to defend the arrested persons , advising them to plead " nolo contendere " , as an alternative to pleading either guilty or not - guilty . the arrested persons were found " guilty , " nevertheless , and given suspended sentences , conditional on their not reentering the test site grounds .

howard zinn writes , " there may be many times when protesters choose to go to jail , as a way of continuing their protest , as a way of reminding their countrymen of injustice . but that is different than the notion that they must go to jail as part of a rule connected with civil disobedience . the key point is that the spirit of protest should be maintained all the way , whether it is done by remaining in jail , or by evading it . to accept jail penitently as an accession to ' the rules ' is to switch suddenly to a spirit of subservience , to demean the seriousness of the protest . . . in particular , the neo - conservative insistence on a guilty plea should be eliminated . "	59	88
sometimes the prosecution proposes a plea bargain to civil disobedients , as in the case of the camden 28 , in which the defendants were offered an opportunity to plead guilty to one misdemeanor count and receive no jail time . in some mass arrest situations , the activists decide to use solidarity tactics to secure the same plea bargain for everyone . but some activists have opted to enter a blind plea , pleading guilty without any plea agreement in place . mohandas gandhi pleaded guilty and told the court , " i am here to . . . submit cheerfully to the highest penalty that can be inflicted upon me for what in law is a deliberate crime and what appears to me to be the highest duty of a citizen . "	41	62
some civil disobedience defendants choose to make a defiant speech , or a speech explaining their actions , in allocution . in u . s . v . burgos - andujar , a defendant who was involved in a movement to stop military exercises by trespassing on u . s . navy property argued to the court in allocution that " the ones who are violating the greater law are the members of the navy " . as a result , the judge increased her sentence from 40 to 60 days . this action was upheld because , according to the u . s . court of appeals for the first circuit , her statement suggested a lack of remorse , an attempt to avoid responsibility for her actions , and even a likelihood of repeating her illegal actions . some of the other allocution speeches given by the protesters complained about mistreatment from government officials .	0	20
one theory is that , while disobedience may be helpful , any great amount of it would undermine the law by encouraging general disobedience which is neither conscientious nor of social benefit . therefore , conscientious lawbreakers must be punished . michael bayles argues that if a person violates a law in order to create a test case as to the constitutionality of a law , and then wins his case , then that act did not constitute civil disobedience . it has also been argued that breaking the law for self - gratification , as in the case of a homosexual or cannabis user who does not direct his act at securing the repeal of amendment of the law , is not civil disobedience . likewise , a protestor who attempts to escape punishment by committing the crime covertly and avoiding attribution , or by denying having committed the crime , or by fleeing the jurisdiction , is generally viewed as not being a civil disobedient .	0	32

courts have distinguished between two types of civil disobedience : " indirect civil disobedience involves violating a law which is not , itself , the object of protest , whereas direct civil disobedience involves protesting the existence of a particular law by breaking that law . " during the vietnam war , courts typically refused to excuse the perpetrators of illegal protests from punishment on the basis of their challenging the legality of the vietnam war ; the courts ruled it was a political question . the necessity defense has sometimes been used as a shadow defense by civil disobedients to deny guilt without denouncing their politically motivated acts , and to present their political beliefs in the courtroom . however , court cases such as u . s . v . schoon have greatly curtailed the availability of the political necessity defense . likewise , when carter wentworth was charged for his role in the clamshell alliance 's 1977 illegal occupation of the seabrook station nuclear power plant , the judge instructed the jury to disregard his competing harms defense , and he was found guilty . fully informed jury association activists have sometimes handed out educational leaflets inside courthouses despite admonitions not to ; according to fija , many of them have escaped prosecution because " prosecutors have reasoned ( correctly ) that if they arrest fully informed jury leafleters , the leaflets will have to be given to the leafleter 's own jury as evidence .

along with giving the offender his " just deserts " , achieving crime control via incapacitation and deterrence is a major goal of criminal punishment . brownlee argues , " bringing in deterrence at the level of justification detracts from the law ’ s engagement in a moral dialogue with the offender as a rational person because it focuses attention on the threat of punishment and not the moral reasons to follow this law . " leonard hubert hoffmann writes , " in deciding whether or not to impose punishment , the most important consideration would be whether it would do more harm than good . this means that the objector has no right not to be punished . it is a matter for the state ( including the judges ) to decide on utilitarian grounds whether to do so or not .

in the modern industrialized world , construction usually involves the translation of designs into reality . a formal design team may be assembled to plan the physical proceedings , and to integrate those proceedings with the other parts . the design usually consists of drawings and specifications , usually prepared by a design team including architect , civil engineers , mechanical engineers , electrical engineers , structural engineers , fire protection engineers , planning consultants , architectural consultants , and archaeological consultants . the design team is most commonly employed by ( i . e . in contract with ) the property owner . under this system , once the design is completed by the design team , a number of construction companies or construction management companies may then be asked to make a bid for the work , either based directly on the design , or on the basis of drawings and a bill of quantities provided by a quantity surveyor . following evaluation of bids , the owner typically awards a contract to the most cost efficient bidder .	163	180
the modern trend in design is toward integration of previously separated specialties , especially among large firms . in the past , architects , interior designers , engineers , developers , construction managers , and general contractors were more likely to be entirely separate companies , even in the larger firms . presently , a firm that is nominally an " architecture " or " construction management " firm may have experts from all related fields as employees , or to have an associated company that provides each necessary skill . thus , each such firm may offer itself as " one - stop shopping " for a construction project , from beginning to end . this is designated as a " design build " contract where the contractor is given a performance specification and must undertake the project from design to construction , while adhering to the performance specifications .	91	115

construction projects can suffer from preventable financial problems . underbids happen when builders ask for too little money to complete the project . cash flow problems exist when the present amount of funding can not cover the current costs for labour and materials , and because they are a matter of having sufficient funds at a specific time , can arise even when the overall total is enough . fraud is a problem in many fields , but is notoriously prevalent in the construction field . financial planning for the project is intended to ensure that a solid plan with adequate safeguards and contingency plans are in place before the project is started and is required to ensure that the plan is properly executed over the life of the project .	69	85

mortgage bankers , accountants , and cost engineers are likely participants in creating an overall plan for the financial management of the building construction project . the presence of the mortgage banker is highly likely , even in relatively small projects since the owner 's equity in the property is the most obvious source of funding for a building project . accountants act to study the expected monetary flow over the life of the project and to monitor the payouts throughout the process . cost engineers and estimators apply expertise to relate the work and materials involved to a proper valuation . cost overruns with government projects have occurred when the contractor identified change orders or project changes that increased costs , which are not subject to competition from other firms as they have already been eliminated from consideration after the initial bid .	102	143

the project must adhere to zoning and building code requirements . constructing a project that fails to adhere to codes does not benefit the owner . some legal requirements come from malum in se considerations , or the desire to prevent things that are indisputably bad – bridge collapses or explosions . other legal requirements come from malum prohibitum considerations , or things that are a matter of custom or expectation , such as isolating businesses to a business district and residences to a residential district . an attorney may seek changes or exemptions in the law that governs the land where the building will be built , either by arguing that a rule is inapplicable ( the bridge design will not cause a collapse ) , or that the custom is no longer needed ( acceptance of live - work spaces has grown in the community ) .	0	10

a construction project is a complex net of contracts and other legal obligations , each of which all parties must carefully consider . a contract is the exchange of a set of obligations between two or more parties , but it is not so simple a matter as trying to get the other side to agree to as much as possible in exchange for as little as possible . the time element in construction means that a delay costs money , and in cases of bottlenecks , the delay can be extremely expensive . thus , the contracts must be designed to ensure that each side is capable of performing the obligations set out . contracts that set out clear expectations and clear paths to accomplishing those expectations are far more likely to result in the project flowing smoothly , whereas poorly drafted contracts lead to confusion and collapse .	0	22

there is also a growing number of new forms of procurement that involve relationship contracting where the emphasis is on a co - operative relationship between the principal and contractor and other stakeholders within a construction project . new forms include partnering such as public - private partnering ( ppps ) aka private finance initiatives ( pfis ) and alliances such as " pure " or " project " alliances and " impure " or " strategic " alliances . the focus on co - operation is to ameliorate the many problems that arise from the often highly competitive and adversarial practices within the construction industry .	0	37
this is the most common method of construction procurement and is well established and recognized . in this arrangement , the architect or engineer acts as the project coordinator . his or her role is to design the works , prepare the specifications and produce construction drawings , administer the contract , tender the works , and manage the works from inception to completion . there are direct contractual links between the architect 's client and the main contractor . any subcontractor has a direct contractual relationship with the main contractor . the procedure continues until the building is ready to occupy .	16	29
the owner produces a list of requirements for a project , giving an overall view of the project 's goals . several d & b contractors present different ideas about how to accomplish these goals . the owner selects the ideas he or she likes best and hires the appropriate contractor . often , it is not just one contractor , but a consortium of several contractors working together . once these have been hired , they begin building the first phase of the project . as they build phase 1 , they design phase 2 . this is in contrast to a design - bid - build contract , where the project is completely designed by the owner , then bid on , then completed .	52	69

private schools , also known as independent schools , non - governmental , or nonstate schools , are not administered by local , state or national governments ; thus , they retain the right to select their students and are funded in whole or in part by charging their students tuition , rather than relying on mandatory taxation through public ( government ) funding ; at some private schools students may be able to get a scholarship , which makes the cost cheaper , depending on a talent the student may have ( e . g . sport scholarship , art scholarship , academic scholarship ) , financial need , or tax credit scholarships that might be available .	0	118

in the united kingdom and several other commonwealth countries including australia and canada , the use of the term is generally restricted to primary and secondary educational levels ; it is almost never used of universities and other tertiary institutions . private education in north america covers the whole gamut of educational activity , ranging from pre - school to tertiary level institutions . annual tuition fees at k - 12 schools range from nothing at so called ' tuition - free ' schools to more than $ 45 , 000 at several new england preparatory schools .	64	97
the secondary level includes schools offering years 7 through 12 ( year twelve is known as lower sixth ) and year 13 ( upper sixth ) . this category includes university - preparatory schools or " prep schools " , boarding schools and day schools . tuition at private secondary schools varies from school to school and depends on many factors , including the location of the school , the willingness of parents to pay , peer tuitions and the school 's financial endowment . high tuition , schools claim , is used to pay higher salaries for the best teachers and also used to provide enriched learning environments , including a low student to teacher ratio , small class sizes and services , such as libraries , science laboratories and computers . some private schools are boarding schools and many military academies are privately owned or operated as well .	0	26

funding for private schools is generally provided through student tuition , endowments , scholarship / voucher funds , and donations and grants from religious organizations or private individuals . government funding for religious schools is either subject to restrictions or possibly forbidden , according to the courts ' interpretation of the establishment clause of the first amendment or individual state blaine amendments . non - religious private schools theoretically could qualify for such funding without hassle , preferring the advantages of independent control of their student admissions and course content instead of the public funding they could get with charter status .	29	101

james bryant conant ( president , 1933 – 1953 ) reinvigorated creative scholarship to guarantee its preeminence among research institutions . he saw higher education as a vehicle of opportunity for the talented rather than an entitlement for the wealthy , so conant devised programs to identify , recruit , and support talented youth . in 1943 , he asked the faculty make a definitive statement about what general education ought to be , at the secondary as well as the college level . the resulting report , published in 1945 , was one of the most influential manifestos in the history of american education in the 20th century .	0	20

neoclassical economics views inequalities in the distribution of income as arising from differences in value added by labor , capital and land . within labor income distribution is due to differences in value added by different classifications of workers . in this perspective , wages and profits are determined by the marginal value added of each economic actor ( worker , capitalist / business owner , landlord ) . thus , in a market economy , inequality is a reflection of the productivity gap between highly - paid professions and lower - paid professions .	0	22

in marxian analysis , capitalist firms increasingly substitute capital equipment for labor inputs ( workers ) under competitive pressure to reduce costs and maximize profits . over the long - term , this trend increases the organic composition of capital , meaning that less workers are required in proportion to capital inputs , increasing unemployment ( the " reserve army of labour " ) . this process exerts a downward pressure on wages . the substitution of capital equipment for labor ( mechanization and automation ) raises the productivity of each worker , resulting in a situation of relatively stagnant wages for the working class amidst rising levels of property income for the capitalist class .	26	64

in a purely capitalist mode of production ( i . e . where professional and labor organizations can not limit the number of workers ) the workers wages will not be controlled by these organizations , or by the employer , but rather by the market . wages work in the same way as prices for any other good . thus , wages can be considered as a function of market price of skill . and therefore , inequality is driven by this price . under the law of supply and demand , the price of skill is determined by a race between the demand for the skilled worker and the supply of the skilled worker . " on the other hand , markets can also concentrate wealth , pass environmental costs on to society , and abuse workers and consumers .

during the mass high school education movement from 1910 – 1940 , there was an increase in skilled workers , which led to a decrease in the price of skilled labor . high school education during the period was designed to equip students with necessary skill sets to be able to perform at work . in fact , it differs from the present high school education , which is regarded as a stepping - stone to acquire college and advanced degrees . this decrease in wages caused a period of compression and decreased inequality between skilled and unskilled workers . education is very important for the growth of the economy , however educational inequality in gender also influence towards the economy . lagerlof and galor stated that gender inequality in education can result to low economic growth , and continued gender inequality in education , thus creating a poverty trap . it is suggested that a large gap in male and female education may indicate backwardness and so may be associated with lower economic growth , which can explain why there is economic inequality between countries .	0	31

sociologist jake rosenfield of the university of washington asserts that the decline of organized labor in the united states has played a more significant role in expanding the income gap than technological changes and globalization , which were also experienced by other industrialized nations that did n't experience steep surges in inequality . he points out that nations with high rates of unionization , particularly in scandinavia , have very low levels of inequality , and concludes " the historical pattern is clear ; the cross - national pattern is clear : high inequality goes hand - in - hand with weak labor movements and vice - versa .

trade liberalization may shift economic inequality from a global to a domestic scale . when rich countries trade with poor countries , the low - skilled workers in the rich countries may see reduced wages as a result of the competition , while low - skilled workers in the poor countries may see increased wages . trade economist paul krugman estimates that trade liberalisation has had a measurable effect on the rising inequality in the united states . he attributes this trend to increased trade with poor countries and the fragmentation of the means of production , resulting in low skilled jobs becoming more tradeable . however , he concedes that the effect of trade on inequality in america is minor when compared to other causes , such as technological innovation , a view shared by other experts . empirical economists max roser and jesus crespo - cuaresma find support in the data that international trade is increasing income inequality . they empirically confirm the predictions of the stolper – samuelson theorem regarding the effects of international trade on the distribution of incomes . lawrence katz estimates that trade has only accounted for 5 - 15 % of rising income inequality . robert lawrence argues that technological innovation and automation has meant that low - skilled jobs have been replaced by machine labor in wealthier nations , and that wealthier countries no longer have significant numbers of low - skilled manufacturing workers that could be affected by competition from poor countries .	202	251

in many countries , there is a gender pay gap in favor of males in the labor market . several factors other than discrimination may contribute to this gap . on average , women are more likely than men to consider factors other than pay when looking for work , and may be less willing to travel or relocate . thomas sowell , in his book knowledge and decisions , claims that this difference is due to women not taking jobs due to marriage or pregnancy , but income studies show that that does not explain the entire difference . a u . s . census 's report stated that in us once other factors are accounted for there is still a difference in earnings between women and men . the income gap in other countries ranges from 53 % in botswana to - 40 % in bahrain .	0	18

economist simon kuznets argued that levels of economic inequality are in large part the result of stages of development . according to kuznets , countries with low levels of development have relatively equal distributions of wealth . as a country develops , it acquires more capital , which leads to the owners of this capital having more wealth and income and introducing inequality . eventually , through various possible redistribution mechanisms such as social welfare programs , more developed countries move back to lower levels of inequality .	64	87

plotting the relationship between level of income and inequality , kuznets saw middle - income developing economies level of inequality bulging out to form what is now known as the kuznets curve . kuznets demonstrated this relationship using cross - sectional data . however , more recent testing of this theory with superior panel data has shown it to be very weak . kuznets ' curve predicts that income inequality will eventually decrease given time . as an example , income inequality did fall in the united states during its high school movement from 1910 to 1940 and thereafter . [ citation needed ] however , recent data shows that the level of income inequality began to rise after the 1970s . this does not necessarily disprove kuznets ' theory .

wealth concentration is a theoretical [ according to whom ? ] process by which , under certain conditions , newly created wealth concentrates in the possession of already - wealthy individuals or entities . according to this theory , those who already hold wealth have the means to invest in new sources of creating wealth or to otherwise leverage the accumulation of wealth , thus are the beneficiaries of the new wealth . over time , wealth condensation can significantly contribute to the persistence of inequality within society . thomas piketty in his book capital in the twenty - first century argues that the fundamental force for divergence is the usually greater return of capital ( r ) than economic growth ( g ) , and that larger fortunes generate higher returns [ pp . 384 table 12 . 2 , u . s . university endowment size vs . real annual rate of return ]	34	72

economist joseph stiglitz argues that rather than explaining concentrations of wealth and income , market forces should serve as a brake on such concentration , which may better be explained by the non - market force known as " rent - seeking " . while the market will bid up compensation for rare and desired skills to reward wealth creation , greater productivity , etc . , it will also prevent successful entrepreneurs from earning excess profits by fostering competition to cut prices , profits and large compensation . a better explainer of growing inequality , according to stiglitz , is the use of political power generated by wealth by certain groups to shape government policies financially beneficial to them . this process , known to economists as rent - seeking , brings income not from creation of wealth but from " grabbing a larger share of the wealth that would otherwise have been produced without their effort "	89	120

for most of human history higher material living standards – full stomachs , access to clean water and warmth from fuel – led to better health and longer lives . this pattern of higher incomes - longer lives still holds among poorer countries , where life expectancy increases rapidly as per capita income increases , but in recent decades it has slowed down among middle income countries and plateaued among the richest thirty or so countries in the world . americans live no longer on average ( about 77 years in 2004 ) than greeks ( 78 years ) or new zealanders ( 78 ) , though the usa has a higher gdp per capita . life expectancy in sweden ( 80 years ) and japan ( 82 ) – where income was more equally distributed – was longer .	116	139

in recent years the characteristic that has strongly correlated with health in developed countries is income inequality . creating an index of " health and social problems " from nine factors , authors richard wilkinson and kate pickett found health and social problems " more common in countries with bigger income inequalities " , and more common among states in the us with larger income inequalities . other studies have confirmed this relationship . the unicef index of " child well - being in rich countries " , studying 40 indicators in 22 countries , correlates with greater equality but not per capita income .	18	66

crime rate has also been shown to be correlated with inequality in society . most studies looking into the relationship have concentrated on homicides – since homicides are almost identically defined across all nations and jurisdictions . there have been over fifty studies showing tendencies for violence to be more common in societies where income differences are larger . research has been conducted comparing developed countries with undeveloped countries , as well as studying areas within countries . daly et al . 2001 found that among u . s states and canadian provinces there is a tenfold difference in homicide rates related to inequality . they estimated that about half of all variation in homicide rates can be accounted for by differences in the amount of inequality in each province or state . fajnzylber et al .

following the utilitarian principle of seeking the greatest good for the greatest number – economic inequality is problematic . a house that provides less utility to a millionaire as a summer home than it would to a homeless family of five , is an example of reduced " distributive efficiency " within society , that decreases marginal utility of wealth and thus the sum total of personal utility . an additional dollar spent by a poor person will go to things providing a great deal of utility to that person , such as basic necessities like food , water , and healthcare ; while , an additional dollar spent by a much richer person will very likely go to luxury items providing relatively less utility to that person . thus , the marginal utility of wealth per person ( " the additional dollar " ) decreases as a person becomes richer . from this standpoint , for any given amount of wealth in society , a society with more equality will have higher aggregate utility . some studies have found evidence for this theory , noting that in societies where inequality is lower , population - wide satisfaction and happiness tend to be higher .	69	128

research by harvard economist robert barro , found that there is " little overall relation between income inequality and rates of growth and investment " . according to work by barro in 1999 and 2000 , high levels of inequality reduce growth in relatively poor countries but encourage growth in richer countries . a study of swedish counties between 1960 and 2000 found a positive impact of inequality on growth with lead times of five years or less , but no correlation after ten years . studies of larger data sets have found no correlations for any fixed lead time , and a negative impact on the duration of growth .	0	25

studies on income inequality and growth have sometimes found evidence confirming the kuznets curve hypothesis , which states that with economic development , inequality first increases , then decreases . economist thomas piketty challenges this notion , claiming that from 1914 to 1945 wars and " violent economic and political shocks " reduced inequality . moreover , piketty argues that the " magical " kuznets curve hypothesis , with its emphasis on the balancing of economic growth in the long run , can not account for the significant increase in economic inequality throughout the developed world since the 1970s .	30	54

some theories developed in the 1970s established possible avenues through which inequality may have a positive effect on economic development . according to a 1955 review , savings by the wealthy , if these increase with inequality , were thought to offset reduced consumer demand . a 2013 report on nigeria suggests that growth has risen with increased income inequality . some theories popular from the 1950s to 2011 incorrectly stated that inequality had a positive effect on economic development . analyses based on comparing yearly equality figures to yearly growth rates were misleading because it takes several years for effects to manifest as changes to economic growth . imf economists found a strong association between lower levels of inequality in developing countries and sustained periods of economic growth . developing countries with high inequality have " succeeded in initiating growth at high rates for a few years " but " longer growth spells are robustly associated with more equality in the income distribution .

while acknowledging the central role economic growth can potentially play in human development , poverty reduction and the achievement of the millennium development goals , it is becoming widely understood amongst the development community that special efforts must be made to ensure poorer sections of society are able to participate in economic growth . the effect of economic growth on poverty reduction – the growth elasticity of poverty – can depend on the existing level of inequality . for instance , with low inequality a country with a growth rate of 2 % per head and 40 % of its population living in poverty , can halve poverty in ten years , but a country with high inequality would take nearly 60 years to achieve the same reduction . in the words of the secretary general of the united nations ban ki - moon : " while economic growth is necessary , it is not sufficient for progress on reducing poverty .

a number of researchers ( david rodda , jacob vigdor , and janna matlack ) , argue that a shortage of affordable housing – at least in the us – is caused in part by income inequality . david rodda noted that from 1984 and 1991 , the number of quality rental units decreased as the demand for higher quality housing increased ( rhoda 1994 : 148 ) . through gentrification of older neighbourhoods , for example , in east new york , rental prices increased rapidly as landlords found new residents willing to pay higher market rate for housing and left lower income families without rental units . the ad valorem property tax policy combined with rising prices made it difficult or impossible for low income residents to keep pace .	38	68

the smaller the economic inequality , the more waste and pollution is created , resulting in many cases , in more environmental degradation . this can be explained by the fact that as the poor people in the society become more wealthy , it increases their yearly carbon emissions . this relation is expressed by the environmental kuznets curve ( ekc ) .

socialists attribute the vast disparities in wealth to the private ownership of the means of production by a class of owners , creating a situation where a small portion of the population lives off unearned property income by virtue of ownership titles in capital equipment , financial assets and corporate stock . by contrast , the vast majority of the population is dependent on income in the form of a wage or salary . in order to rectify this situation , socialists argue that the means of production should be socially owned so that income differentials would be reflective of individual contributions to the social product .	0	51

from the late 1340s onwards , people in the countryside suffered from frequent natural disasters such as droughts , floods and the resulting famines , and the government 's lack of effective policy led to a loss of popular support . in 1351 , the red turban rebellion started and grew into a nationwide uprising . in 1354 , when toghtogha led a large army to crush the red turban rebels , toghun temur suddenly dismissed him for fear of betrayal . this resulted in toghun temur 's restoration of power on the one hand and a rapid weakening of the central government on the other . he had no choice but to rely on local warlords ' military power , and gradually lost his interest in politics and ceased to intervene in political struggles . he fled north to shangdu from khanbaliq ( present - day beijing ) in 1368 after the approach of the forces of the ming dynasty ( 1368 – 1644 ) , founded by zhu yuanzhang in the south . he had tried to regain khanbaliq , which eventually failed ; he died in yingchang ( located in present - day inner mongolia ) two years later ( 1370 ) . yingchang was seized by the ming shortly after his death . some royal family members still lived in henan today .	136	174

the average mongol garrison family of the yuan dynasty seems to have lived a life of decaying rural leisure , with income from the harvests of their chinese tenants eaten up by costs of equipping and dispatching men for their tours of duty . the mongols practiced debt slavery , and by 1290 in all parts of the mongol empire commoners were selling their children into slavery . seeing this as damaging to the mongol nation , kublai in 1291 forbade the sale abroad of mongols . kublai wished to persuade the chinese that he was becoming increasingly sinicized while maintaining his mongolian credentials with his own people . he set up a civilian administration to rule , built a capital within china , supported chinese religions and culture , and devised suitable economic and political institutions for the court . but at the same time he never abandoned his mongolian heritage .	44	67

in the china of the yuan , or mongol era , various important developments in the arts occurred or continued in their development , including the areas of painting , mathematics , calligraphy , poetry , and theater , with many great artists and writers being famous today . due to the coming together of painting , poetry , and calligraphy at this time many of the artists practicing these different pursuits were the same individuals , though perhaps more famed for one area of their achievements than others . often in terms of the further development of landscape painting as well as the classical joining together of the arts of painting , poetry , and calligraphy , the song dynasty and the yuan dynasty are linked together . in the area of chinese painting during the yuan dynasty there were many famous painters . in the area of calligraphy many of the great calligraphers were from the yuan dynasty era . in yuan poetry , the main development was the qu , which was used among other poetic forms by most of the famous yuan poets . many of the poets were also involved in the major developments in the theater during this time , and the other way around , with people important in the theater becoming famous through the development of the sanqu type of qu . one of the key factors in the mix of the zaju variety show was the incorporation of poetry both classical and of the newer qu form . one of the important cultural developments during the yuan era was the consolidation of poetry , painting , and calligraphy into a unified piece of the type that tends to come to mind when people think of classical chinese art . another important aspect of yuan times is the increasing incorporation of the then current , vernacular chinese into both the qu form of poetry and the zaju variety show . another important consideration regarding yuan dynasty arts and culture is that so much of it has survived in china , relatively to works from the tang dynasty and song dynasty , which have often been better preserved in places such as the shosoin , in japan .	0	48
there were many religions practiced during the yuan dynasty , such as buddhism , islam , and christianity . the establishment of the yuan dynasty had dramatically increased the number of muslims in china . however , unlike the western khanates , the yuan dynasty never converted to islam . instead , kublai khan , the founder of the yuan dynasty , favored buddhism , especially the tibetan variants . as a result , tibetan buddhism was established as the de facto state religion . the top - level department and government agency known as the bureau of buddhist and tibetan affairs ( xuanzheng yuan ) was set up in khanbaliq ( modern beijing ) to supervise buddhist monks throughout the empire . since kublai khan only esteemed the sakya sect of tibetan buddhism , other religions became less important . he and his successors kept a sakya imperial preceptor ( dishi ) at court . before the end of the yuan dynasty , 14 leaders of the sakya sect had held the post of imperial preceptor , thereby enjoying special power . furthermore , mongol patronage of buddhism resulted in a number of monuments of buddhist art . mongolian buddhist translations , almost all from tibetan originals , began on a large scale after 1300 . many mongols of the upper class such as the jalayir and the oronar nobles as well as the emperors also patronized confucian scholars and institutions . a considerable number of confucian and chinese historical works were translated into the mongolian language .	35	49

when the mongols placed the uighurs of the kingdom of qocho over the koreans at the court the korean king objected , then the mongol emperor kublai khan rebuked the korean king , saying that the uighur king of qocho was ranked higher than the karluk kara - khanid ruler , who in turn was ranked higher than the korean king , who was ranked last , because the uighurs surrendered to the mongols first , the karluks surrendered after the uighurs , and the koreans surrendered last , and that the uighurs surrendered peacefully without violently resisting .	0	98

the immune system is a system of many biological structures and processes within an organism that protects against disease . to function properly , an immune system must detect a wide variety of agents , known as pathogens , from viruses to parasitic worms , and distinguish them from the organism 's own healthy tissue . in many species , the immune system can be classified into subsystems , such as the innate immune system versus the adaptive immune system , or humoral immunity versus cell - mediated immunity . in humans , the blood – brain barrier , blood – cerebrospinal fluid barrier , and similar fluid – brain barriers separate the peripheral immune system from the neuroimmune system which protects the brain .	90	124

disorders of the immune system can result in autoimmune diseases , inflammatory diseases and cancer . immunodeficiency occurs when the immune system is less active than normal , resulting in recurring and life - threatening infections . in humans , immunodeficiency can either be the result of a genetic disease such as severe combined immunodeficiency , acquired conditions such as hiv / aids , or the use of immunosuppressive medication . in contrast , autoimmunity results from a hyperactive immune system attacking normal tissues as if they were foreign organisms . common autoimmune diseases include hashimoto 's thyroiditis , rheumatoid arthritis , diabetes mellitus type 1 , and systemic lupus erythematosus . immunology covers the study of all aspects of the immune system .	71	90

immunology is a science that examines the structure and function of the immune system . it originates from medicine and early studies on the causes of immunity to disease . the earliest known reference to immunity was during the plague of athens in 430 bc . thucydides noted that people who had recovered from a previous bout of the disease could nurse the sick without contracting the illness a second time . in the 18th century , pierre - louis moreau de maupertuis made experiments with scorpion venom and observed that certain dogs and mice were immune to this venom . this and other observations of acquired immunity were later exploited by louis pasteur in his development of vaccination and his proposed germ theory of disease . pasteur 's theory was in direct opposition to contemporary theories of disease , such as the miasma theory . it was not until robert koch 's 1891 proofs , for which he was awarded a nobel prize in 1905 , that microorganisms were confirmed as the cause of infectious disease . viruses were confirmed as human pathogens in 1901 , with the discovery of the yellow fever virus by walter reed .	30	45
the immune system protects organisms from infection with layered defenses of increasing specificity . in simple terms , physical barriers prevent pathogens such as bacteria and viruses from entering the organism . if a pathogen breaches these barriers , the innate immune system provides an immediate , but non - specific response . innate immune systems are found in all plants and animals . if pathogens successfully evade the innate response , vertebrates possess a second layer of protection , the adaptive immune system , which is activated by the innate response . here , the immune system adapts its response during an infection to improve its recognition of the pathogen . this improved response is then retained after the pathogen has been eliminated , in the form of an immunological memory , and allows the adaptive immune system to mount faster and stronger attacks each time this pathogen is encountered .	64	92

both innate and adaptive immunity depend on the ability of the immune system to distinguish between self and non - self molecules . in immunology , self molecules are those components of an organism 's body that can be distinguished from foreign substances by the immune system . conversely , non - self molecules are those recognized as foreign molecules . one class of non - self molecules are called antigens ( short for antibody generators ) and are defined as substances that bind to specific immune receptors and elicit an immune response .	23	47

several barriers protect organisms from infection , including mechanical , chemical , and biological barriers . the waxy cuticle of many leaves , the exoskeleton of insects , the shells and membranes of externally deposited eggs , and skin are examples of mechanical barriers that are the first line of defense against infection . however , as organisms can not be completely sealed from their environments , other systems act to protect body openings such as the lungs , intestines , and the genitourinary tract . in the lungs , coughing and sneezing mechanically eject pathogens and other irritants from the respiratory tract . the flushing action of tears and urine also mechanically expels pathogens , while mucus secreted by the respiratory and gastrointestinal tract serves to trap and entangle microorganisms .	86	103

chemical barriers also protect against infection . the skin and respiratory tract secrete antimicrobial peptides such as the β - defensins . enzymes such as lysozyme and phospholipase a2 in saliva , tears , and breast milk are also antibacterials . vaginal secretions serve as a chemical barrier following menarche , when they become slightly acidic , while semen contains defensins and zinc to kill pathogens . in the stomach , gastric acid and proteases serve as powerful chemical defenses against ingested pathogens .	22	40
inflammation is one of the first responses of the immune system to infection . the symptoms of inflammation are redness , swelling , heat , and pain , which are caused by increased blood flow into tissue . inflammation is produced by eicosanoids and cytokines , which are released by injured or infected cells . eicosanoids include prostaglandins that produce fever and the dilation of blood vessels associated with inflammation , and leukotrienes that attract certain white blood cells ( leukocytes ) . common cytokines include interleukins that are responsible for communication between white blood cells ; chemokines that promote chemotaxis ; and interferons that have anti - viral effects , such as shutting down protein synthesis in the host cell . growth factors and cytotoxic factors may also be released . these cytokines and other chemicals recruit immune cells to the site of infection and promote healing of any damaged tissue following the removal of pathogens .	38	54

phagocytosis is an important feature of cellular innate immunity performed by cells called ' phagocytes ' that engulf , or eat , pathogens or particles . phagocytes generally patrol the body searching for pathogens , but can be called to specific locations by cytokines . once a pathogen has been engulfed by a phagocyte , it becomes trapped in an intracellular vesicle called a phagosome , which subsequently fuses with another vesicle called a lysosome to form a phagolysosome . the pathogen is killed by the activity of digestive enzymes or following a respiratory burst that releases free radicals into the phagolysosome . phagocytosis evolved as a means of acquiring nutrients , but this role was extended in phagocytes to include engulfment of pathogens as a defense mechanism . phagocytosis probably represents the oldest form of host defense , as phagocytes have been identified in both vertebrate and invertebrate animals .	26	44

neutrophils and macrophages are phagocytes that travel throughout the body in pursuit of invading pathogens . neutrophils are normally found in the bloodstream and are the most abundant type of phagocyte , normally representing 50 % to 60 % of the total circulating leukocytes . during the acute phase of inflammation , particularly as a result of bacterial infection , neutrophils migrate toward the site of inflammation in a process called chemotaxis , and are usually the first cells to arrive at the scene of infection . macrophages are versatile cells that reside within tissues and produce a wide array of chemicals including enzymes , complement proteins , and regulatory factors such as interleukin 1 . macrophages also act as scavengers , ridding the body of worn - out cells and other debris , and as antigen - presenting cells that activate the adaptive immune system .	0	15

leukocytes ( white blood cells ) act like independent , single - celled organisms and are the second arm of the innate immune system . the innate leukocytes include the phagocytes ( macrophages , neutrophils , and dendritic cells ) , mast cells , eosinophils , basophils , and natural killer cells . these cells identify and eliminate pathogens , either by attacking larger pathogens through contact or by engulfing and then killing microorganisms . innate cells are also important mediators in the activation of the adaptive immune system .	0	24
dendritic cells ( dc ) are phagocytes in tissues that are in contact with the external environment ; therefore , they are located mainly in the skin , nose , lungs , stomach , and intestines . they are named for their resemblance to neuronal dendrites , as both have many spine - like projections , but dendritic cells are in no way connected to the nervous system . dendritic cells serve as a link between the bodily tissues and the innate and adaptive immune systems , as they present antigens to t cells , one of the key cell types of the adaptive immune system .	37	68

natural killer cells , or nk cells , are a component of the innate immune system which does not directly attack invading microbes . rather , nk cells destroy compromised host cells , such as tumor cells or virus - infected cells , recognizing such cells by a condition known as " missing self . " this term describes cells with low levels of a cell - surface marker called mhc i ( major histocompatibility complex ) – a situation that can arise in viral infections of host cells . they were named " natural killer " because of the initial notion that they do not require activation in order to kill cells that are " missing self . " for many years it was unclear how nk cells recognize tumor cells and infected cells . it is now known that the mhc makeup on the surface of those cells is altered and the nk cells become activated through recognition of " missing self " . normal body cells are not recognized and attacked by nk cells because they express intact self mhc antigens . those mhc antigens are recognized by killer cell immunoglobulin receptors ( kir ) which essentially put the brakes on nk cells .	0	23
killer t cells are a sub - group of t cells that kill cells that are infected with viruses ( and other pathogens ) , or are otherwise damaged or dysfunctional . as with b cells , each type of t cell recognizes a different antigen . killer t cells are activated when their t cell receptor ( tcr ) binds to this specific antigen in a complex with the mhc class i receptor of another cell . recognition of this mhc : antigen complex is aided by a co - receptor on the t cell , called cd8 . the t cell then travels throughout the body in search of cells where the mhc i receptors bear this antigen . when an activated t cell contacts such cells , it releases cytotoxins , such as perforin , which form pores in the target cell 's plasma membrane , allowing ions , water and toxins to enter . the entry of another toxin called granulysin ( a protease ) induces the target cell to undergo apoptosis . t cell killing of host cells is particularly important in preventing the replication of viruses . t cell activation is tightly controlled and generally requires a very strong mhc / antigen activation signal , or additional activation signals provided by " helper " t cells ( see below ) .	0	31

helper t cells express t cell receptors ( tcr ) that recognize antigen bound to class ii mhc molecules . the mhc : antigen complex is also recognized by the helper cell 's cd4 co - receptor , which recruits molecules inside the t cell ( e . g . , lck ) that are responsible for the t cell 's activation . helper t cells have a weaker association with the mhc : antigen complex than observed for killer t cells , meaning many receptors ( around 200 – 300 ) on the helper t cell must be bound by an mhc : antigen in order to activate the helper cell , while killer t cells can be activated by engagement of a single mhc : antigen molecule . helper t cell activation also requires longer duration of engagement with an antigen - presenting cell . the activation of a resting helper t cell causes it to release cytokines that influence the activity of many cell types . cytokine signals produced by helper t cells enhance the microbicidal function of macrophages and the activity of killer t cells . in addition , helper t cell activation causes an upregulation of molecules expressed on the t cell 's surface , such as cd40 ligand ( also called cd154 ) , which provide extra stimulatory signals typically required to activate antibody - producing b cells .	147	168
gamma delta t cells ( γδ t cells ) possess an alternative t cell receptor ( tcr ) as opposed to cd4 + and cd8 + ( αβ ) t cells and share the characteristics of helper t cells , cytotoxic t cells and nk cells . the conditions that produce responses from γδ t cells are not fully understood . like other ' unconventional ' t cell subsets bearing invariant tcrs , such as cd1d - restricted natural killer t cells , γδ t cells straddle the border between innate and adaptive immunity . on one hand , γδ t cells are a component of adaptive immunity as they rearrange tcr genes to produce receptor diversity and can also develop a memory phenotype . on the other hand , the various subsets are also part of the innate immune system , as restricted tcr or nk receptors may be used as pattern recognition receptors . for example , large numbers of human vγ9 / vδ2 t cells respond within hours to common molecules produced by microbes , and highly restricted vδ1 + t cells in epithelia respond to stressed epithelial cells .	0	46
newborn infants have no prior exposure to microbes and are particularly vulnerable to infection . several layers of passive protection are provided by the mother . during pregnancy , a particular type of antibody , called igg , is transported from mother to baby directly across the placenta , so human babies have high levels of antibodies even at birth , with the same range of antigen specificities as their mother . breast milk or colostrum also contains antibodies that are transferred to the gut of the infant and protect against bacterial infections until the newborn can synthesize its own antibodies . this is passive immunity because the fetus does not actually make any memory cells or antibodies — it only borrows them . this passive immunity is usually short - term , lasting from a few days up to several months . in medicine , protective passive immunity can also be transferred artificially from one individual to another via antibody - rich serum .	26	71
hormones can act as immunomodulators , altering the sensitivity of the immune system . for example , female sex hormones are known immunostimulators of both adaptive and innate immune responses . some autoimmune diseases such as lupus erythematosus strike women preferentially , and their onset often coincides with puberty . by contrast , male sex hormones such as testosterone seem to be immunosuppressive . other hormones appear to regulate the immune system as well , most notably prolactin , growth hormone and vitamin d .	31	49
when suffering from sleep deprivation , active immunizations may have a diminished effect and may result in lower antibody production , and a lower immune response , than would be noted in a well - rested individual . additionally , proteins such as nfil3 , which have been shown to be closely intertwined with both t - cell differentiation and our circadian rhythms , can be affected through the disturbance of natural light and dark cycles through instances of sleep deprivation , shift work , etc . as a result , these disruptions can lead to an increase in chronic conditions such as heart disease , chronic pain , and asthma .	38	86
the main response of the immune system to tumors is to destroy the abnormal cells using killer t cells , sometimes with the assistance of helper t cells . tumor antigens are presented on mhc class i molecules in a similar way to viral antigens . this allows killer t cells to recognize the tumor cell as abnormal . nk cells also kill tumorous cells in a similar way , especially if the tumor cells have fewer mhc class i molecules on their surface than normal ; this is a common phenomenon with tumors . sometimes antibodies are generated against tumor cells allowing for their destruction by the complement system .	0	28
unlike animals , plants lack phagocytic cells , but many plant immune responses involve systemic chemical signals that are sent through a plant . individual plant cells respond to molecules associated with pathogens known as pathogen - associated molecular patterns or pamps . when a part of a plant becomes infected , the plant produces a localized hypersensitive response , whereby cells at the site of infection undergo rapid apoptosis to prevent the spread of the disease to other parts of the plant . systemic acquired resistance ( sar ) is a type of defensive response used by plants that renders the entire plant resistant to a particular infectious agent . rna silencing mechanisms are particularly important in this systemic response as they can block virus replication .	43	83

overactive immune responses comprise the other end of immune dysfunction , particularly the autoimmune disorders . here , the immune system fails to properly distinguish between self and non - self , and attacks part of the body . under normal circumstances , many t cells and antibodies react with " self " peptides . one of the functions of specialized cells ( located in the thymus and bone marrow ) is to present young lymphocytes with self antigens produced throughout the body and to eliminate those cells that recognize self - antigens , preventing autoimmunity .	55	96
immunodeficiencies occur when one or more of the components of the immune system are inactive . the ability of the immune system to respond to pathogens is diminished in both the young and the elderly , with immune responses beginning to decline at around 50 years of age due to immunosenescence . in developed countries , obesity , alcoholism , and drug use are common causes of poor immune function . however , malnutrition is the most common cause of immunodeficiency in developing countries . diets lacking sufficient protein are associated with impaired cell - mediated immunity , complement activity , phagocyte function , iga antibody concentrations , and cytokine production . additionally , the loss of the thymus at an early age through genetic mutation or surgical removal results in severe immunodeficiency and a high susceptibility to infection .	71	84

long - term active memory is acquired following infection by activation of b and t cells . active immunity can also be generated artificially , through vaccination . the principle behind vaccination ( also called immunization ) is to introduce an antigen from a pathogen in order to stimulate the immune system and develop specific immunity against that particular pathogen without causing disease associated with that organism . this deliberate induction of an immune response is successful because it exploits the natural specificity of the immune system , as well as its inducibility . with infectious disease remaining one of the leading causes of death in the human population , vaccination represents the most effective manipulation of the immune system mankind has developed .	68	93
the success of any pathogen depends on its ability to elude host immune responses . therefore , pathogens evolved several methods that allow them to successfully infect a host , while evading detection or destruction by the immune system . bacteria often overcome physical barriers by secreting enzymes that digest the barrier , for example , by using a type ii secretion system . alternatively , using a type iii secretion system , they may insert a hollow tube into the host cell , providing a direct route for proteins to move from the pathogen to the host . these proteins are often used to shut down host defenses .	40	63

in the mid - 1950s , frank burnet , inspired by a suggestion made by niels jerne , formulated the clonal selection theory ( cst ) of immunity . on the basis of cst , burnet developed a theory of how an immune response is triggered according to the self / nonself distinction : " self " constituents ( constituents of the body ) do not trigger destructive immune responses , while " nonself " entities ( pathogens , an allograft ) trigger a destructive immune response . the theory was later modified to reflect new discoveries regarding histocompatibility or the complex " two - signal " activation of t cells . the self / nonself theory of immunity and the self / nonself vocabulary have been criticized , but remain very influential .	0	28
anti - inflammatory drugs are often used to control the effects of inflammation . glucocorticoids are the most powerful of these drugs ; however , these drugs can have many undesirable side effects , such as central obesity , hyperglycemia , osteoporosis , and their use must be tightly controlled . lower doses of anti - inflammatory drugs are often used in conjunction with cytotoxic or immunosuppressive drugs such as methotrexate or azathioprine . cytotoxic drugs inhibit the immune response by killing dividing cells such as activated t cells . however , the killing is indiscriminate and other constantly dividing cells and their organs are affected , which causes toxic side effects . immunosuppressive drugs such as cyclosporin prevent t cells from responding to signals correctly by inhibiting signal transduction pathways .	14	50
in contrast , during wake periods differentiated effector cells , such as cytotoxic natural killer cells and ctls ( cytotoxic t lymphocytes ) , peak in order to elicit an effective response against any intruding pathogens . as well during awake active times , anti - inflammatory molecules , such as cortisol and catecholamines , peak . there are two theories as to why the pro - inflammatory state is reserved for sleep time . first , inflammation would cause serious cognitive and physical impairments if it were to occur during wake times . second , inflammation may occur during sleep times due to the presence of melatonin . inflammation causes a great deal of oxidative stress and the presence of melatonin during sleep times could actively counteract free radical production during this time .	37	56
when a t - cell encounters a foreign pathogen , it extends a vitamin d receptor . this is essentially a signaling device that allows the t - cell to bind to the active form of vitamin d , the steroid hormone calcitriol . t - cells have a symbiotic relationship with vitamin d . not only does the t - cell extend a vitamin d receptor , in essence asking to bind to the steroid hormone version of vitamin d , calcitriol , but the t - cell expresses the gene cyp27b1 , which is the gene responsible for converting the pre - hormone version of vitamin d , calcidiol into the steroid hormone version , calcitriol . only after binding to calcitriol can t - cells perform their intended function . other immune system cells that are known to express cyp27b1 and thus activate vitamin d calcidiol , are dendritic cells , keratinocytes and macrophages .	55	118

pattern recognition receptors are proteins used by nearly all organisms to identify molecules associated with pathogens . antimicrobial peptides called defensins are an evolutionarily conserved component of the innate immune response found in all animals and plants , and represent the main form of invertebrate systemic immunity . the complement system and phagocytic cells are also used by most forms of invertebrate life . ribonucleases and the rna interference pathway are conserved across all eukaryotes , and are thought to play a role in the immune response to viruses .	0	16

immunology is strongly experimental in everyday practice but is also characterized by an ongoing theoretical attitude . many theories have been suggested in immunology from the end of the nineteenth century up to the present time . the end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century saw a battle between " cellular " and " humoral " theories of immunity . according to the cellular theory of immunity , represented in particular by elie metchnikoff , it was cells – more precisely , phagocytes – that were responsible for immune responses . in contrast , the humoral theory of immunity , held , among others , by robert koch and emil von behring , stated that the active immune agents were soluble components ( molecules ) found in the organism ’ s “ humors ” rather than its cells .	65	95

clearly , some tumors evade the immune system and go on to become cancers . tumor cells often have a reduced number of mhc class i molecules on their surface , thus avoiding detection by killer t cells . some tumor cells also release products that inhibit the immune response ; for example by secreting the cytokine tgf - β , which suppresses the activity of macrophages and lymphocytes . in addition , immunological tolerance may develop against tumor antigens , so the immune system no longer attacks the tumor cells .	39	69

hypersensitivity is an immune response that damages the body 's own tissues . they are divided into four classes ( type i – iv ) based on the mechanisms involved and the time course of the hypersensitive reaction . type i hypersensitivity is an immediate or anaphylactic reaction , often associated with allergy . symptoms can range from mild discomfort to death . type i hypersensitivity is mediated by ige , which triggers degranulation of mast cells and basophils when cross - linked by antigen . type ii hypersensitivity occurs when antibodies bind to antigens on the patient 's own cells , marking them for destruction . this is also called antibody - dependent ( or cytotoxic ) hypersensitivity , and is mediated by igg and igm antibodies . immune complexes ( aggregations of antigens , complement proteins , and igg and igm antibodies ) deposited in various tissues trigger type iii hypersensitivity reactions . type iv hypersensitivity ( also known as cell - mediated or delayed type hypersensitivity ) usually takes between two and three days to develop . type iv reactions are involved in many autoimmune and infectious diseases , but may also involve contact dermatitis ( poison ivy ) . these reactions are mediated by t cells , monocytes , and macrophages .	86	106

an evasion strategy used by several pathogens to avoid the innate immune system is to hide within the cells of their host ( also called intracellular pathogenesis ) . here , a pathogen spends most of its life - cycle inside host cells , where it is shielded from direct contact with immune cells , antibodies and complement . some examples of intracellular pathogens include viruses , the food poisoning bacterium salmonella and the eukaryotic parasites that cause malaria ( plasmodium falciparum ) and leishmaniasis ( leishmania spp . ) . other bacteria , such as mycobacterium tuberculosis , live inside a protective capsule that prevents lysis by complement . many pathogens secrete compounds that diminish or misdirect the host 's immune response . some bacteria form biofilms to protect themselves from the cells and proteins of the immune system . such biofilms are present in many successful infections , e . g . , the chronic pseudomonas aeruginosa and burkholderia cenocepacia infections characteristic of cystic fibrosis . other bacteria generate surface proteins that bind to antibodies , rendering them ineffective ; examples include streptococcus ( protein g ) , staphylococcus aureus ( protein a ) , and peptostreptococcus magnus ( protein l ) .	0	28
the mechanisms used to evade the adaptive immune system are more complicated . the simplest approach is to rapidly change non - essential epitopes ( amino acids and / or sugars ) on the surface of the pathogen , while keeping essential epitopes concealed . this is called antigenic variation . an example is hiv , which mutates rapidly , so the proteins on its viral envelope that are essential for entry into its host target cell are constantly changing . these frequent changes in antigens may explain the failures of vaccines directed at this virus . the parasite trypanosoma brucei uses a similar strategy , constantly switching one type of surface protein for another , allowing it to stay one step ahead of the antibody response . masking antigens with host molecules is another common strategy for avoiding detection by the immune system . in hiv , the envelope that covers the virion is formed from the outermost membrane of the host cell ; such " self - cloaked " viruses make it difficult for the immune system to identify them as " non - self " structures .	51	80

larger drugs ( > 500 da ) can provoke a neutralizing immune response , particularly if the drugs are administered repeatedly , or in larger doses . this limits the effectiveness of drugs based on larger peptides and proteins ( which are typically larger than 6000 da ) . in some cases , the drug itself is not immunogenic , but may be co - administered with an immunogenic compound , as is sometimes the case for taxol . computational methods have been developed to predict the immunogenicity of peptides and proteins , which are particularly useful in designing therapeutic antibodies , assessing likely virulence of mutations in viral coat particles , and validation of proposed peptide - based drug treatments . early techniques relied mainly on the observation that hydrophilic amino acids are overrepresented in epitope regions than hydrophobic amino acids ; however , more recent developments rely on machine learning techniques using databases of existing known epitopes , usually on well - studied virus proteins , as a training set . a publicly accessible database has been established for the cataloguing of epitopes from pathogens known to be recognizable by b cells . the emerging field of bioinformatics - based studies of immunogenicity is referred to as immunoinformatics . immunoproteomics is the study of large sets of proteins ( proteomics ) involved in the immune response .	122	172

pathogens can rapidly evolve and adapt , and thereby avoid detection and neutralization by the immune system ; however , multiple defense mechanisms have also evolved to recognize and neutralize pathogens . even simple unicellular organisms such as bacteria possess a rudimentary immune system , in the form of enzymes that protect against bacteriophage infections . other basic immune mechanisms evolved in ancient eukaryotes and remain in their modern descendants , such as plants and invertebrates . these mechanisms include phagocytosis , antimicrobial peptides called defensins , and the complement system . jawed vertebrates , including humans , have even more sophisticated defense mechanisms , including the ability to adapt over time to recognize specific pathogens more efficiently . adaptive ( or acquired ) immunity creates immunological memory after an initial response to a specific pathogen , leading to an enhanced response to subsequent encounters with that same pathogen . this process of acquired immunity is the basis of vaccination .	119	149

in humans , this response is activated by complement binding to antibodies that have attached to these microbes or the binding of complement proteins to carbohydrates on the surfaces of microbes . this recognition signal triggers a rapid killing response . the speed of the response is a result of signal amplification that occurs following sequential proteolytic activation of complement molecules , which are also proteases . after complement proteins initially bind to the microbe , they activate their protease activity , which in turn activates other complement proteases , and so on . this produces a catalytic cascade that amplifies the initial signal by controlled positive feedback . the cascade results in the production of peptides that attract immune cells , increase vascular permeability , and opsonize ( coat ) the surface of a pathogen , marking it for destruction . this deposition of complement can also kill cells directly by disrupting their plasma membrane .	41	66

in 2001 , 16 national science academies issued a joint statement on climate change . the joint statement was made by the australian academy of science , the royal flemish academy of belgium for science and the arts , the brazilian academy of sciences , the royal society of canada , the caribbean academy of sciences , the chinese academy of sciences , the french academy of sciences , the german academy of natural scientists leopoldina , the indian national science academy , the indonesian academy of sciences , the royal irish academy , accademia nazionale dei lincei ( italy ) , the academy of sciences malaysia , the academy council of the royal society of new zealand , the royal swedish academy of sciences , and the royal society ( uk ) . the statement , also published as an editorial in the journal science , stated " we support the [ tar 's ] conclusion that it is at least 90 % certain that temperatures will continue to rise , with average global surface temperature projected to increase by between 1 . 4 and 5 . 8 ° c above 1990 levels by 2100 " . the tar has also been endorsed by the canadian foundation for climate and atmospheric sciences , canadian meteorological and oceanographic society , and european geosciences union ( refer to " endorsements of the ipcc " ) .	0	14
ipcc author richard lindzen has made a number of criticisms of the tar . among his criticisms , lindzen has stated that the wgi summary for policymakers ( spm ) does not faithfully summarize the full wgi report . for example , lindzen states that the spm understates the uncertainty associated with climate models . john houghton , who was a co - chair of tar wgi , has responded to lindzen 's criticisms of the spm . houghton has stressed that the spm is agreed upon by delegates from many of the world 's governments , and that any changes to the spm must be supported by scientific evidence .	0	13
in addition to climate assessment reports , the ipcc is publishing special reports on specific topics . the preparation and approval process for all ipcc special reports follows the same procedures as for ipcc assessment reports . in the year 2011 two ipcc special report were finalized , the special report on renewable energy sources and climate change mitigation ( srren ) and the special report on managing risks of extreme events and disasters to advance climate change adaptation ( srex ) . both special reports were requested by governments .	37	82
the third assessment report ( tar ) prominently featured a graph labeled " millennial northern hemisphere temperature reconstruction " based on a 1999 paper by michael e . mann , raymond s . bradley and malcolm k . hughes ( mbh99 ) , which has been referred to as the " hockey stick graph " . this graph extended the similar graph in figure 3 . 20 from the ipcc second assessment report of 1995 , and differed from a schematic in the first assessment report that lacked temperature units , but appeared to depict larger global temperature variations over the past 1000 years , and higher temperatures during the medieval warm period than the mid 20th century . the schematic was not an actual plot of data , and was based on a diagram of temperatures in central england , with temperatures increased on the basis of documentary evidence of medieval vineyards in england . even with this increase , the maximum it showed for the medieval warm period did not reach temperatures recorded in central england in 2007 . the mbh99 finding was supported by cited reconstructions by jones et al . 1998 , pollack , huang & shen 1998 , crowley & lowery 2000 and briffa 2000 , using differing data and methods . the jones et al . and briffa reconstructions were overlaid with the mbh99 reconstruction in figure 2 . 21 of the ipcc report .	0	55
these studies were widely presented as demonstrating that the current warming period is exceptional in comparison to temperatures between 1000 and 1900 , and the mbh99 based graph featured in publicity . even at the draft stage , this finding was disputed by contrarians : in may 2000 fred singer 's science and environmental policy project held a press event on capitol hill , washington , d . c . , featuring comments on the graph wibjorn karlen and singer argued against the graph at a united states senate committee on commerce , science and transportation hearing on 18 july 2000 . contrarian john lawrence daly featured a modified version of the ipcc 1990 schematic , which he mis - identified as appearing in the ipcc 1995 report , and argued that " overturning its own previous view in the 1995 report , the ipcc presented the ' hockey stick ' as the new orthodoxy with hardly an apology or explanation for the abrupt u - turn since its 1995 report " . criticism of the mbh99 reconstruction in a review paper , which was quickly discredited in the soon and baliunas controversy , was picked up by the bush administration , and a senate speech by us republican senator james inhofe alleged that " manmade global warming is the greatest hoax ever perpetrated on the american people " . the data and methodology used to produce the " hockey stick graph " was criticized in papers by stephen mcintyre and ross mckitrick , and in turn the criticisms in these papers were examined by other studies and comprehensively refuted by wahl & ammann 2007 , which showed errors in the methods used by mcintyre and mckitrick .	0	31

on 23 june 2005 , rep . joe barton , chairman of the house committee on energy and commerce wrote joint letters with ed whitfield , chairman of the subcommittee on oversight and investigations demanding full records on climate research , as well as personal information about their finances and careers , from mann , bradley and hughes . sherwood boehlert , chairman of the house science committee , said this was a " misguided and illegitimate investigation " apparently aimed at intimidating scientists , and at his request the u . s . national academy of sciences arranged for its national research council to set up a special investigation . the national research council 's report agreed that there were some statistical failings , but these had little effect on the graph , which was generally correct . in a 2006 letter to nature , mann , bradley , and hughes pointed out that their original article had said that " more widespread high - resolution data are needed before more confident conclusions can be reached " and that the uncertainties were " the point of the article " .	0	58

another example of scientific research which suggests that previous estimates by the ipcc , far from overstating dangers and risks , have actually understated them is a study on projected rises in sea levels . when the researchers ' analysis was " applied to the possible scenarios outlined by the intergovernmental panel on climate change ( ipcc ) , the researchers found that in 2100 sea levels would be 0 . 5 – 1 . 4 m [ 50 – 140 cm ] above 1990 levels . these values are much greater than the 9 – 88 cm as projected by the ipcc itself in its third assessment report , published in 2001 " . this may have been due , in part , to the expanding human understanding of climate .	35	86

michael oppenheimer , a long - time participant in the ipcc and coordinating lead author of the fifth assessment report conceded in science magazine 's state of the planet 2008 - 2009 some limitations of the ipcc consensus approach and asks for concurring , smaller assessments of special problems instead of the large scale approach as in the previous ipcc assessment reports . it has become more important to provide a broader exploration of uncertainties . others see as well mixed blessings of the drive for consensus within the ipcc process and ask to include dissenting or minority positions or to improve statements about uncertainties .	0	62
according to sheldon ungar 's comparison with global warming , the actors in the ozone depletion case had a better understanding of scientific ignorance and uncertainties . the ozone case communicated to lay persons " with easy - to - understand bridging metaphors derived from the popular culture " and related to " immediate risks with everyday relevance " , while the public opinion on climate change sees no imminent danger . the stepwise mitigation of the ozone layer challenge was based as well on successfully reducing regional burden sharing conflicts . in case of the ipcc conclusions and the failure of the kyoto protocol , varying regional cost - benefit analysis and burden - sharing conflicts with regard to the distribution of emission reductions remain an unsolved problem . in the uk , a report for a house of lords committee asked to urge the ipcc to involve better assessments of costs and benefits of climate change but the stern review ordered by the uk government made a stronger argument in favor to combat human - made climate change .	0	26
since the ipcc does not carry out its own research , it operates on the basis of scientific papers and independently documented results from other scientific bodies , and its schedule for producing reports requires a deadline for submissions prior to the report 's final release . in principle , this means that any significant new evidence or events that change our understanding of climate science between this deadline and publication of an ipcc report can not be included . in an area of science where our scientific understanding is rapidly changing , this has been raised as a serious shortcoming in a body which is widely regarded as the ultimate authority on the science . however , there has generally been a steady evolution of key findings and levels of scientific confidence from one assessment report to the next .

a prime number ( or a prime ) is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself . a natural number greater than 1 that is not a prime number is called a composite number . for example , 5 is prime because 1 and 5 are its only positive integer factors , whereas 6 is composite because it has the divisors 2 and 3 in addition to 1 and 6 . the fundamental theorem of arithmetic establishes the central role of primes in number theory : any integer greater than 1 can be expressed as a product of primes that is unique up to ordering . the uniqueness in this theorem requires excluding 1 as a prime because one can include arbitrarily many instances of 1 in any factorization , e . g . , 3 , 1 · 3 , 1 · 1 · 3 , etc . are all valid factorizations of 3 .	80	114

the property of being prime ( or not ) is called primality . a simple but slow method of verifying the primality of a given number n is known as trial division . it consists of testing whether n is a multiple of any integer between 2 and . algorithms much more efficient than trial division have been devised to test the primality of large numbers . these include the miller – rabin primality test , which is fast but has a small probability of error , and the aks primality test , which always produces the correct answer in polynomial time but is too slow to be practical . particularly fast methods are available for numbers of special forms , such as mersenne numbers . as of january 2016 [ update ] , the largest known prime number has 22 , 338 , 618 decimal digits .	13	32

a large body of mathematical work would still be valid when calling 1 a prime , but euclid 's fundamental theorem of arithmetic ( mentioned above ) would not hold as stated . for example , the number 15 can be factored as 3 · 5 and 1 · 3 · 5 ; if 1 were admitted as a prime , these two presentations would be considered different factorizations of 15 into prime numbers , so the statement of that theorem would have to be modified . similarly , the sieve of eratosthenes would not work correctly if 1 were considered a prime : a modified version of the sieve that considers 1 as prime would eliminate all multiples of 1 ( that is , all other numbers ) and produce as output only the single number 1 . furthermore , the prime numbers have several properties that the number 1 lacks , such as the relationship of the number to its corresponding value of euler 's totient function or the sum of divisors function .	139	175

the most basic method of checking the primality of a given integer n is called trial division . this routine consists of dividing n by each integer m that is greater than 1 and less than or equal to the square root of n . if the result of any of these divisions is an integer , then n is not a prime , otherwise it is a prime . indeed , if is composite ( with a and b = 1 ) then one of the factors a or b is necessarily at most . for example , for , the trial divisions are by m = 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , and 6 . none of these numbers divides 37 , so 37 is prime . this routine can be implemented more efficiently if a complete list of primes up to is known — then trial divisions need to be checked only for those m that are prime . for example , to check the primality of 37 , only three divisions are necessary ( m = 2 , 3 , and 5 ) , given that 4 and 6 are composite .	131	163

modern primality tests for general numbers n can be divided into two main classes , probabilistic ( or " monte carlo " ) and deterministic algorithms . deterministic algorithms provide a way to tell for sure whether a given number is prime or not . for example , trial division is a deterministic algorithm because , if performed correctly , it will always identify a prime number as prime and a composite number as composite . probabilistic algorithms are normally faster , but do not completely prove that a number is prime . these tests rely on testing a given number in a partly random way . for example , a given test might pass all the time if applied to a prime number , but pass only with probability p if applied to a composite number . if we repeat the test n times and pass every time , then the probability that our number is composite is 1 / ( 1 - p ) n , which decreases exponentially with the number of tests , so we can be as sure as we like ( though never perfectly sure ) that the number is prime . on the other hand , if the test ever fails , then we know that the number is composite .	45	75

the concept of prime number is so important that it has been generalized in different ways in various branches of mathematics . generally , " prime " indicates minimality or indecomposability , in an appropriate sense . for example , the prime field is the smallest subfield of a field f containing both 0 and 1 . it is either q or the finite field with p elements , whence the name . often a second , additional meaning is intended by using the word prime , namely that any object can be , essentially uniquely , decomposed into its prime components . for example , in knot theory , a prime knot is a knot that is indecomposable in the sense that it can not be written as the knot sum of two nontrivial knots . any knot can be uniquely expressed as a connected sum of prime knots . prime models and prime 3 - manifolds are other examples of this type .	103	136

a regulation of the rhine was called for , with an upper canal near diepoldsau and a lower canal at fußach , in order to counteract the constant flooding and strong sedimentation in the western rhine delta . the dornbirner ach had to be diverted , too , and it now flows parallel to the canalized rhine into the lake . its water has a darker color than the rhine ; the latter 's lighter suspended load comes from higher up the mountains . it is expected that the continuous input of sediment into the lake will silt up the lake . this has already happened to the former lake tuggenersee .	0	37

the rhine - meuse delta , the most important natural region of the netherlands begins near millingen aan de rijn , close to the dutch - german border with the division of the rhine into waal and nederrijn . since the rhine contributes most of the water , the shorter term rhine delta is commonly used . however , this name is also used for the river delta where the rhine flows into lake constance , so it is clearer to call the larger one rhine - meuse delta , or even rhine – meuse – scheldt delta , as the scheldt ends in the same delta .	0	38
the shape of the rhine delta is determined by two bifurcations : first , at millingen aan de rijn , the rhine splits into waal and pannerdens kanaal , which changes its name to nederrijn at angeren , and second near arnhem , the ijssel branches off from the nederrijn . this creates three main flows , two of which change names rather often . the largest and southern main branch begins as waal and continues as boven merwede ( " upper merwede " ) , beneden merwede ( " lower merwede " ) , noord river ( " north river " ) , nieuwe maas ( " new meuse " ) , het scheur ( " the rip " ) and nieuwe waterweg ( " new waterway " ) . the middle flow begins as nederrijn , then changes into lek , then joins the noord , thereby forming nieuwe maas . the northern flow keeps the name ijssel until it flows into lake ijsselmeer . three more flows carry significant amounts of water : the nieuwe merwede ( " new merwede " ) , which branches off from the southern branch where it changes from boven to beneden merwede ; the oude maas ( " old meuse " ) , which branches off from the southern branch where it changes from beneden merwede into noord , and dordtse kil , which branches off from oude maas .	65	130
before the st . elizabeth 's flood ( 1421 ) , the meuse flowed just south of today 's line merwede - oude maas to the north sea and formed an archipelago - like estuary with waal and lek . this system of numerous bays , estuary - like extended rivers , many islands and constant changes of the coastline , is hard to imagine today . from 1421 to 1904 , the meuse and waal merged further upstream at gorinchem to form merwede . for flood protection reasons , the meuse was separated from the waal through a lock and diverted into a new outlet called " bergse maas " , then amer and then flows into the former bay hollands diep .	67	84

the hydrography of the current delta is characterized by the delta 's main arms , disconnected arms ( hollandse ijssel , linge , vecht , etc . ) and smaller rivers and streams . many rivers have been closed ( " dammed " ) and now serve as drainage channels for the numerous polders . the construction of delta works changed the delta in the second half of the 20th century fundamentally . currently rhine water runs into the sea , or into former marine bays now separated from the sea , in five places , namely at the mouths of the nieuwe merwede , nieuwe waterway ( nieuwe maas ) , dordtse kil , spui and ijssel .	55	72
the rhine - meuse delta is a tidal delta , shaped not only by the sedimentation of the rivers , but also by tidal currents . this meant that high tide formed a serious risk because strong tidal currents could tear huge areas of land into the sea . before the construction of the delta works , tidal influence was palpable up to nijmegen , and even today , after the regulatory action of the delta works , the tide acts far inland . at the waal , for example , the most landward tidal influence can be detected between brakel and zaltbommel .	26	48
in southern europe , the stage was set in the triassic period of the mesozoic era , with the opening of the tethys ocean , between the eurasian and african tectonic plates , between about 240 mbp and 220 mbp ( million years before present ) . the present mediterranean sea descends from this somewhat larger tethys sea . at about 180 mbp , in the jurassic period , the two plates reversed direction and began to compress the tethys floor , causing it to be subducted under eurasia and pushing up the edge of the latter plate in the alpine orogeny of the oligocene and miocene periods . several microplates were caught in the squeeze and rotated or were pushed laterally , generating the individual features of mediterranean geography : iberia pushed up the pyrenees ; italy , the alps , and anatolia , moving west , the mountains of greece and the islands . the compression and orogeny continue today , as shown by the ongoing raising of the mountains a small amount each year and the active volcanoes .	0	46

from the eocene onwards , the ongoing alpine orogeny caused a n – s rift system to develop in this zone . the main elements of this rift are the upper rhine graben , in southwest germany and eastern france and the lower rhine embayment , in northwest germany and the southeastern netherlands . by the time of the miocene , a river system had developed in the upper rhine graben , that continued northward and is considered the first rhine river . at that time , it did not yet carry discharge from the alps ; instead , the watersheds of the rhone and danube drained the northern flanks of the alps .	0	21
through stream capture , the rhine extended its watershed southward . by the pliocene period , the rhine had captured streams down to the vosges mountains , including the mosel , the main and the neckar . the northern alps were then drained by the rhone . by the early pleistocene period , the rhine had captured most of its current alpine watershed from the rhone , including the aar . since that time , the rhine has added the watershed above lake constance ( vorderrhein , hinterrhein , alpenrhein ; captured from the rhone ) , the upper reaches of the main , beyond schweinfurt and the vosges mountains , captured from the meuse , to its watershed .	0	10

around 2 . 5 million years ago ( ending 11 , 600 years ago ) was the geological period of the ice ages . since approximately 600 , 000 years ago , six major ice ages have occurred , in which sea level dropped 120 m ( 390 ft ) and much of the continental margins became exposed . in the early pleistocene , the rhine followed a course to the northwest , through the present north sea . during the so - called anglian glaciation ( ~ 450 , 000 yr bp , marine oxygen isotope stage 12 ) , the northern part of the present north sea was blocked by the ice and a large lake developed , that overflowed through the english channel . this caused the rhine 's course to be diverted through the english channel . since then , during glacial times , the river mouth was located offshore of brest , france and rivers , like the thames and the seine , became tributaries to the rhine . during interglacials , when sea level rose to approximately the present level , the rhine built deltas , in what is now the netherlands .	24	58
the last glacial ran from ~ 74 , 000 ( bp = before present ) , until the end of the pleistocene ( ~ 11 , 600 bp ) . in northwest europe , it saw two very cold phases , peaking around 70 , 000 bp and around 29 , 000 – 24 , 000 bp . the last phase slightly predates the global last ice age maximum ( last glacial maximum ) . during this time , the lower rhine flowed roughly west through the netherlands and extended to the southwest , through the english channel and finally , to the atlantic ocean . the english channel , the irish channel and most of the north sea were dry land , mainly because sea level was approximately 120 m ( 390 ft ) lower than today .	0	29
most of the rhine 's current course was not under the ice during the last ice age ; although , its source must still have been a glacier . a tundra , with ice age flora and fauna , stretched across middle europe , from asia to the atlantic ocean . such was the case during the last glacial maximum , ca . 22 , 000 – 14 , 000 yr bp , when ice - sheets covered scandinavia , the baltics , scotland and the alps , but left the space between as open tundra . the loess or wind - blown dust over that tundra , settled in and around the rhine valley , contributing to its current agricultural usefulness .	63	96

since 7500 yr ago , a situation with tides and currents , very similar to present has existed . rates of sea - level rise had dropped so far , that natural sedimentation by the rhine and coastal processes together , could compensate the transgression by the sea ; in the last 7000 years , the coast line was roughly at the same location . in the southern north sea , due to ongoing tectonic subsidence , the sea level is still rising , at the rate of about 1 – 3 cm ( 0 . 39 – 1 . 18 in ) per century ( 1 metre or 39 inches in last 3000 years ) .	0	18

at the begin of the holocene ( ~ 11 , 700 years ago ) , the rhine occupied its late - glacial valley . as a meandering river , it reworked its ice - age braidplain . as sea - level continued to rise in the netherlands , the formation of the holocene rhine - meuse delta began ( ~ 8 , 000 years ago ) . coeval absolute sea - level rise and tectonic subsidence have strongly influenced delta evolution . other factors of importance to the shape of the delta are the local tectonic activities of the peel boundary fault , the substrate and geomorphology , as inherited from the last glacial and the coastal - marine dynamics , such as barrier and tidal inlet formations .	0	23

since ~ 3000 yr bp ( = years before present ) , human impact is seen in the delta . as a result of increasing land clearance ( bronze age agriculture ) , in the upland areas ( central germany ) , the sediment load of the rhine has strongly increased and delta growth has sped up . this caused increased flooding and sedimentation , ending peat formation in the delta . the shifting of river channels to new locations , on the floodplain ( termed avulsion ) , was the main process distributing sediment across the subrecent delta . over the past 6000 years , approximately 80 avulsions have occurred . direct human impact in the delta started with peat mining , for salt and fuel , from roman times onward . this was followed by embankment , of the major distributaries and damming of minor distributaries , which took place in the 11 – 13th century ad . thereafter , canals were dug , bends were short cut and groynes were built , to prevent the river 's channels from migrating or silting up .	133	159

from the death of augustus in ad 14 until after ad 70 , rome accepted as her germanic frontier the water - boundary of the rhine and upper danube . beyond these rivers she held only the fertile plain of frankfurt , opposite the roman border fortress of moguntiacum ( mainz ) , the southernmost slopes of the black forest and a few scattered bridge - heads . the northern section of this frontier , where the rhine is deep and broad , remained the roman boundary until the empire fell . the southern part was different . the upper rhine and upper danube are easily crossed . the frontier which they form is inconveniently long , enclosing an acute - angled wedge of foreign territory between the modern baden and wurttemberg . the germanic populations of these lands seem in roman times to have been scanty , and roman subjects from the modern alsace - lorraine had drifted across the river eastwards .	0	29
the romans kept eight legions in five bases along the rhine . the actual number of legions present at any base or in all , depended on whether a state or threat of war existed . between about ad 14 and 180 , the assignment of legions was as follows : for the army of germania inferior , two legions at vetera ( xanten ) , i germanica and xx valeria ( pannonian troops ) ; two legions at oppidum ubiorum ( " town of the ubii " ) , which was renamed to colonia agrippina , descending to cologne , v alaudae , a celtic legion recruited from gallia narbonensis and xxi , possibly a galatian legion from the other side of the empire .	0	11

since the peace of westphalia , the upper rhine formed a contentious border between france and germany . establishing " natural borders " on the rhine was a long - term goal of french foreign policy , since the middle ages , though the language border was – and is – far more to the west . french leaders , such as louis xiv and napoleon bonaparte , tried with varying degrees of success to annex lands west of the rhine . the confederation of the rhine was established by napoleon , as a french client state , in 1806 and lasted until 1814 , during which time it served as a significant source of resources and military manpower for the first french empire . in 1840 , the rhine crisis , prompted by french prime minister adolphe thiers 's desire to reinstate the rhine as a natural border , led to a diplomatic crisis and a wave of nationalism in germany .	125	162

following a referendum in 1997 , in which the scottish electorate voted for devolution , the current parliament was convened by the scotland act 1998 , which sets out its powers as a devolved legislature . the act delineates the legislative competence of the parliament – the areas in which it can make laws – by explicitly specifying powers that are " reserved " to the parliament of the united kingdom . the scottish parliament has the power to legislate in all areas that are not explicitly reserved to westminster . the british parliament retains the ability to amend the terms of reference of the scottish parliament , and can extend or reduce the areas in which it can make laws . the first meeting of the new parliament took place on 12 may 1999 .	0	35
during this time , the discovery of oil in the north sea and the following " it 's scotland 's oil " campaign of the scottish national party ( snp ) resulted in rising support for scottish independence , as well as the snp . the party argued that the revenues from the oil were not benefitting scotland as much as they should . the combined effect of these events led to prime minister wilson committing his government to some form of devolved legislature in 1974 . however , it was not until 1978 that final legislative proposals for a scottish assembly were passed by the united kingdom parliament .	87	109
since september 2004 , the official home of the scottish parliament has been a new scottish parliament building , in the holyrood area of edinburgh . the scottish parliament building was designed by spanish architect enric miralles in partnership with local edinburgh architecture firm rmjm which was led by design principal tony kettle . some of the principal features of the complex include leaf - shaped buildings , a grass - roofed branch merging into adjacent parkland and gabion walls formed from the stones of previous buildings . throughout the building there are many repeated motifs , such as shapes based on raeburn 's skating minister . crow - stepped gables and the upturned boat skylights of the garden lobby , complete the unique architecture . queen elizabeth ii opened the new building on 9 october 2004 .	0	25
whilst the permanent building at holyrood was being constructed , the parliament 's temporary home was the general assembly hall of the church of scotland on the royal mile in edinburgh . official photographs and television interviews were held in the courtyard adjoining the assembly hall , which is part of the school of divinity of the university of edinburgh . this building was vacated twice to allow for the meeting of the church 's general assembly . in may 2000 , the parliament was temporarily relocated to the former strathclyde regional council debating chamber in glasgow , and to the university of aberdeen in may 2002 .	78	107
after each election to the scottish parliament , at the beginning of each parliamentary session , parliament elects one msp to serve as presiding officer , the equivalent of the speaker ( currently tricia marwick ) , and two msps to serve as deputies ( currently elaine smith and john scott ) . the presiding officer and deputies are elected by a secret ballot of the 129 msps , which is the only secret ballot conducted in the scottish parliament . principally , the role of the presiding officer is to chair chamber proceedings and the scottish parliamentary corporate body . when chairing meetings of the parliament , the presiding officer and his / her deputies must be politically impartial . during debates , the presiding officer ( or the deputy ) is assisted by the parliamentary clerks , who give advice on how to interpret the standing orders that govern the proceedings of meetings . a vote clerk sits in front of the presiding officer and operates the electronic voting equipment and chamber clocks .	0	52
as a member of the scottish parliamentary corporate body , the presiding officer is responsible for ensuring that the parliament functions effectively and has the staff , property and resources it requires to operate . convening the parliamentary bureau , which allocates time and sets the work agenda in the chamber , is another of the roles of the presiding officer . under the standing orders of the parliament the bureau consists of the presiding officer and one representative from each political parties with five or more seats in the parliament . amongst the duties of the bureau are to agree the timetable of business in the chamber , establish the number , remit and membership of parliamentary committees and regulate the passage of legislation ( bills ) through the parliament . the presiding officer also represents the scottish parliament at home and abroad in an official capacity .	0	34
the first item of business on wednesdays is usually time for reflection , at which a speaker addresses members for up to four minutes , sharing a perspective on issues of faith . this contrasts with the formal style of " prayers " , which is the first item of business in meetings of the house of commons . speakers are drawn from across scotland and are chosen to represent the balance of religious beliefs according to the scottish census . invitations to address parliament in this manner are determined by the presiding officer on the advice of the parliamentary bureau . faith groups can make direct representations to the presiding officer to nominate speakers .	81	101
the presiding officer ( or deputy presiding officer ) decides who speaks in chamber debates and the amount of time for which they are allowed to speak . normally , the presiding officer tries to achieve a balance between different viewpoints and political parties when selecting members to speak . typically , ministers or party leaders open debates , with opening speakers given between 5 and 20 minutes , and succeeding speakers allocated less time . the presiding officer can reduce speaking time if a large number of members wish to participate in the debate . debate is more informal than in some parliamentary systems . members may call each other directly by name , rather than by constituency or cabinet position , and hand clapping is allowed . speeches to the chamber are normally delivered in english , but members may use scots , gaelic , or any other language with the agreement of the presiding officer . the scottish parliament has conducted debates in the gaelic language .	50	75
each sitting day , normally at 5 pm , msps decide on all the motions and amendments that have been moved that day . this " decision time " is heralded by the sounding of the division bell , which is heard throughout the parliamentary campus and alerts msps who are not in the chamber to return and vote . at decision time , the presiding officer puts questions on the motions and amendments by reading out the name of the motion or amendment as well as the proposer and asking " are we all agreed ? " , to which the chamber first votes orally . if there is audible dissent , the presiding officer announces " there will be a division " and members vote by means of electronic consoles on their desks . each msp has a unique access card with a microchip which , when inserted into the console , identifies them and allows them to vote . as a result , the outcome of each division is known in seconds .	24	59
the outcome of most votes can be predicted beforehand since political parties normally instruct members which way to vote . parties entrust some msps , known as whips , with the task of ensuring that party members vote according to the party line . msps do not tend to vote against such instructions , since those who do are unlikely to reach higher political ranks in their parties . errant members can be deselected as official party candidates during future elections , and , in serious cases , may be expelled from their parties outright . thus , as with many parliaments , the independence of members of the scottish parliament tends to be low , and backbench rebellions by members who are discontent with their party 's policies are rare . in some circumstances , however , parties announce " free votes " , which allows members to vote as they please . this is typically done on moral issues .	20	43
much of the work of the scottish parliament is done in committee . the role of committees is stronger in the scottish parliament than in other parliamentary systems , partly as a means of strengthening the role of backbenchers in their scrutiny of the government and partly to compensate for the fact that there is no revising chamber . the principal role of committees in the scottish parliament is to take evidence from witnesses , conduct inquiries and scrutinise legislation . committee meetings take place on tuesday , wednesday and thursday morning when parliament is sitting . committees can also meet at other locations throughout scotland .	0	12
a further type of committee is normally set up to scrutinise private bills submitted to the scottish parliament by an outside party or promoter who is not a member of the scottish parliament or scottish government . private bills normally relate to large - scale development projects such as infrastructure projects that require the use of land or property . private bill committees have been set up to consider legislation on issues such as the development of the edinburgh tram network , the glasgow airport rail link , the airdrie - bathgate rail link and extensions to the national gallery of scotland .	0	36
the scotland act 1998 , which was passed by the parliament of the united kingdom and given royal assent by queen elizabeth ii on 19 november 1998 , governs the functions and role of the scottish parliament and delimits its legislative competence . the scotland act 2012 extends the devolved competencies . for the purposes of parliamentary sovereignty , the parliament of the united kingdom at westminster continues to constitute the supreme legislature of scotland . however , under the terms of the scotland act , westminster agreed to devolve some of its responsibilities over scottish domestic policy to the scottish parliament . such " devolved matters " include education , health , agriculture and justice . the scotland act enabled the scottish parliament to pass primary legislation on these issues . a degree of domestic authority , and all foreign policy , remain with the uk parliament in westminster . the scottish parliament has the power to pass laws and has limited tax - varying capability . another of the roles of the parliament is to hold the scottish government to account .	0	42

reserved matters are subjects that are outside the legislative competence of the scotland parliament . the scottish parliament is unable to legislate on such issues that are reserved to , and dealt with at , westminster ( and where ministerial functions usually lie with uk government ministers ) . these include abortion , broadcasting policy , civil service , common markets for uk goods and services , constitution , electricity , coal , oil , gas , nuclear energy , defence and national security , drug policy , employment , foreign policy and relations with europe , most aspects of transport safety and regulation , national lottery , protection of borders , social security and stability of uk 's fiscal , economic and monetary system .	15	48

stage 3 is the final stage of the bill and is considered at a meeting of the whole parliament . this stage comprises two parts : consideration of amendments to the bill as a general debate , and a final vote on the bill . opposition members can table " wrecking amendments " to the bill , designed to thwart further progress and take up parliamentary time , to cause the bill to fall without a final vote being taken . after a general debate on the final form of the bill , members proceed to vote at decision time on whether they agree to the general principles of the final bill .	81	112
royal assent : after the bill has been passed , the presiding officer submits it to the monarch for royal assent and it becomes an act of the scottish parliament . however he can not do so until a 4 - week period has elapsed , during which the law officers of the scottish government or uk government can refer the bill to the supreme court of the united kingdom for a ruling on whether it is within the powers of the parliament . acts of the scottish parliament do not begin with a conventional enacting formula . instead they begin with a phrase that reads : " the bill for this act of the scottish parliament was passed by the parliament on [ date ] and received royal assent on [ date ] " .	3	30
the party , or parties , that hold the majority of seats in the parliament forms the scottish government . in contrast to many other parliamentary systems , parliament elects a first minister from a number of candidates at the beginning of each parliamentary term ( after a general election ) . any member can put their name forward to be first minister , and a vote is taken by all members of parliament . normally , the leader of the largest party is returned as first minister , and head of the scottish government . theoretically , parliament also elects the scottish ministers who form the government of scotland and sit in the scottish cabinet , but such ministers are , in practice , appointed to their roles by the first minister . junior ministers , who do not attend cabinet , are also appointed to assist scottish ministers in their departments . most ministers and their juniors are drawn from amongst the elected msps , with the exception of scotland 's chief law officers : the lord advocate and the solicitor general . whilst the first minister chooses the ministers – and may decide to remove them at any time – the formal appointment or dismissal is made by the sovereign .	154	184
under the scotland act 1998 , ordinary general elections for the scottish parliament are held on the first thursday in may every four years ( 1999 , 2003 , 2007 and so on ) . the date of the poll may be varied by up to one month either way by the monarch on the proposal of the presiding officer . if the parliament itself resolves that it should be dissolved ( with at least two - thirds of the members voting in favour ) , or if the parliament fails to nominate one of its members to be first minister within 28 days of a general election or of the position becoming vacant , the presiding officer proposes a date for an extraordinary general election and the parliament is dissolved by the queen by royal proclamation . extraordinary general elections are in addition to ordinary general elections , unless held less than six months before the due date of an ordinary general election , in which case they supplant it . the following ordinary election reverts to the first thursday in may , a multiple of four years after 1999 ( i . e . , 5 may 2011 , 7 may 2015 , etc . ) .	35	60
of the 129 msps , 73 are elected to represent first past the post constituencies and are known as " constituency msps " . voters choose one member to represent the constituency , and the member with most votes is returned as a constituency msp . the 73 scottish parliament constituencies shared the same boundaries as the uk parliament constituencies in scotland , prior to the 2005 reduction in the number of scottish mps , with the exception of orkney and shetland which each return their own constituency msp . currently , the average scottish parliament constituency comprises 55 , 000 electors . given the geographical distribution of population in scotland , this results in constituencies of a smaller area in the central lowlands , where the bulk of scotland 's population live , and much larger constituency areas in the north and west of the country , which have a low population density . the island archipelagos of orkney , shetland and the western isles comprise a much smaller number of electors , due to their dispersed population and distance from the scottish parliament in edinburgh . if a constituency msp resigns from parliament , this triggers a by - election in his or her constituency , where a replacement msp is returned from one of the parties by the plurality system .	0	23
the total number of seats in the parliament are allocated to parties proportionally to the number of votes received in the second vote of the ballot using the d'hondt method . for example , to determine who is awarded the first list seat , the number of list votes cast for each party is divided by one plus the number of seats the party won in the region ( at this point just constituency seats ) . the party with the highest quotient is awarded the seat , which is then added to its constituency seats in allocating the second seat . this is repeated iteratively until all available list seats are allocated .	0	30
for the conservatives , the main disappointment was the loss of edinburgh pentlands , the seat of former party leader david mcletchie , to the snp . mcletchie was elected on the lothian regional list and the conservatives suffered a net loss of five seats , with leader annabel goldie claiming that their support had held firm . nevertheless , she too announced she would step down as leader of the party . cameron congratulated the snp on their victory but vowed to campaign for the union in the independence referendum .	73	91

a procedural consequence of the establishment of the scottish parliament is that scottish mps sitting in the uk house of commons are able to vote on domestic legislation that applies only to england , wales and northern ireland – whilst english , scottish , welsh and northern irish westminster mps are unable to vote on the domestic legislation of the scottish parliament . this phenomenon is known as the west lothian question and has led to criticism . following the conservative victory in the 2015 uk election , standing orders of the house of commons were changed to give mps representing english constituencies a new " veto " over laws only affecting england .	78	113

another major division within islamism is between what graham e . fuller has described as the fundamentalist " guardians of the tradition " ( salafis , such as those in the wahhabi movement ) and the " vanguard of change and islamic reform " centered around the muslim brotherhood . olivier roy argues that " sunni pan - islamism underwent a remarkable shift in the second half of the 20th century " when the muslim brotherhood movement and its focus on islamisation of pan - arabism was eclipsed by the salafi movement with its emphasis on " sharia rather than the building of islamic institutions , " and rejection of shia islam . following the arab spring , roy has described islamism as " increasingly interdependent " with democracy in much of the arab muslim world , such that " neither can now survive without the other . " while islamist political culture itself may not be democratic , islamists need democratic elections to maintain their legitimacy . at the same time , their popularity is such that no government can call itself democratic that excludes mainstream islamist groups .	0	49

another factor in the early 1990s that worked to radicalize the islamist movement was the gulf war , which brought several hundred thousand us and allied non - muslim military personnel to saudi arabian soil to put an end to saddam hussein 's occupation of kuwait . prior to 1990 saudi arabia played an important role in restraining the many islamist groups that received its aid . but when saddam , secularist and ba'athist dictator of neighboring iraq , attacked saudi arabia ( his enemy in the war ) , western troops came to protect the saudi monarchy . islamists accused the saudi regime of being a puppet of the west .	0	46

these attacks resonated with conservative muslims and the problem did not go away with saddam 's defeat either , since american troops remained stationed in the kingdom , and a de facto cooperation with the palestinian - israeli peace process developed . saudi arabia attempted to compensate for its loss of prestige among these groups by repressing those domestic islamists who attacked it ( bin laden being a prime example ) , and increasing aid to islamic groups ( islamist madrassas around the world and even aiding some violent islamist groups ) that did not , but its pre - war influence on behalf of moderation was greatly reduced . one result of this was a campaign of attacks on government officials and tourists in egypt , a bloody civil war in algeria and osama bin laden 's terror attacks climaxing in the 9 / 11 attack .	0	41

" formal imperialism " is defined as " physical control or full - fledged colonial rule " . " informal imperialism " is less direct ; however , it is still a powerful form of dominance .	46	69

the definition of imperialism has not been finalized for centuries and was confusedly seen to represent the policies of major powers , or simply , general - purpose aggressiveness . further on , some writers [ who ? ] used the term imperialism , in slightly more discriminating fashion , to mean all kinds of domination or control by a group of people over another . to clear out this confusion about the definition of imperialism one could speak of " formal " and " informal " imperialism , the first meaning physical control or " full - fledged colonial rule " while the second implied less direct rule though still containing perceivable kinds of dominance . informal rule is generally less costly than taking over territories formally . this is because , with informal rule , the control is spread more subtly through technological superiority , enforcing land officials into large debts that can not be repaid , ownership of private industries thus expanding the controlled area , or having countries agree to uneven trade agreements forcefully .	66	116

the term " imperialism " is often conflated with " colonialism " , however many scholars have argued that each have their own distinct definition . imperialism and colonialism have been used in order to describe one 's superiority , domination and influence upon a person or group of people . robert young writes that while imperialism operates from the center , is a state policy and is developed for ideological as well as financial reasons , colonialism is simply the development for settlement or commercial intentions . colonialism in modern usage also tends to imply a degree of geographic separation between the colony and the imperial power . particularly , edward said distinguishes the difference between imperialism and colonialism by stating ; " imperialism involved ' the practice , the theory and the attitudes of a dominating metropolitan center ruling a distant territory ' , while colonialism refers to the ' implanting of settlements on a distant territory . ' contiguous land empires such as the russian or ottoman are generally excluded from discussions of colonialism . : 116 thus it can be said that imperialism includes some form of colonialism , but colonialism itself does not automatically imply imperialism , as it lacks a political focus .

imperialism and colonialism both dictate the political and economic advantage over a land and the indigenous populations they control , yet scholars sometimes find it difficult to illustrate the difference between the two . although imperialism and colonialism focus on the suppression of an other , if colonialism refers to the process of a country taking physical control of another , imperialism refers to the political and monetary dominance , either formally or informally . colonialism is seen to be the architect deciding how to start dominating areas and then imperialism can be seen as creating the idea behind conquest cooperating with colonialism . colonialism is when the imperial nation begins a conquest over an area and then eventually is able to rule over the areas the previous nation had controlled . colonialism 's core meaning is the exploitation of the valuable assets and supplies of the nation that was conquered and the conquering nation then gaining the benefits from the spoils of the war . the meaning of imperialism is to create an empire , by conquering the other state 's lands and therefore increasing its own dominance . colonialism is the builder and preserver of the colonial possessions in an area by a population coming from a foreign region . colonialism can completely change the existing social structure , physical structure and economics of an area ; it is not unusual that the characteristics of the conquering peoples are inherited by the conquered indigenous populations .	132	165

orientalism , as theorized by edward said , refers to how the west developed an imaginative geography of the east . this imaginative geography relies on an essentializing discourse that represents neither the diversity nor the social reality of the east . rather , by essentializing the east , this discourse uses the idea of place - based identities to create difference and distance between " we " the west and " them " the east , or " here " in the west and " there " in the east . this difference was particularly apparent in textual and visual works of early european studies of the orient that positioned the east as irrational and backward in opposition to the rational and progressive west . defining the east as a negative vision of itself , as its inferior , not only increased the west ’ s sense of self , but also was a way of ordering the east and making it known to the west so that it could be dominated and controlled . the discourse of orientalism therefore served as an ideological justification of early western imperialism , as it formed a body of knowledge and ideas that rationalized social , cultural , political , and economic control of other territories .	92	125

to better illustrate this idea , bassett focuses his analysis of the role of nineteenth - century maps during the " scramble for africa " . he states that maps " contributed to empire by promoting , assisting , and legitimizing the extension of french and british power into west africa " . during his analysis of nineteenth - century cartographic techniques , he highlights the use of blank space to denote unknown or unexplored territory . this provided incentives for imperial and colonial powers to obtain " information to fill in blank spaces on contemporary maps " .	53	76

imperialism has played an important role in the histories of japan , korea , the assyrian empire , the chinese empire , the roman empire , greece , the byzantine empire , the persian empire , the ottoman empire , ancient egypt , the british empire , india , and many other empires . imperialism was a basic component to the conquests of genghis khan during the mongol empire , and of other war - lords . historically recognized muslim empires number in the dozens . sub - saharan africa has also featured dozens of empires that predate the european colonial era , for example the ethiopian empire , oyo empire , asante union , luba empire , lunda empire , and mutapa empire . the americas during the pre - columbian era also had large empires such as the aztec empire and the incan empire .	77	85

in anglophone academic works , theories regarding imperialism are often based on the british experience . the term " imperialism " was originally introduced into english in its present sense in the late 1870s by opponents of the allegedly aggressive and ostentatious imperial policies of british prime minister benjamin disraeli . it was shortly appropriated by supporters of " imperialism " such as joseph chamberlain . for some , imperialism designated a policy of idealism and philanthropy ; others alleged that it was characterized by political self - interest , and a growing number associated it with capitalist greed . liberal john a . hobson and marxist vladimir lenin added a more theoretical macroeconomic connotation to the term . lenin in particular exerted substantial influence over later marxist conceptions of imperialism with his work imperialism , the highest stage of capitalism . in his writings lenin portrayed imperialism as a natural extension of capitalism that arose from need for capitalist economies to constantly expand investment , material resources and manpower in such a way that necessitated colonial expansion . this conception of imperialism as a structural feature of capitalism is echoed by later marxist theoreticians . many theoreticians on the left have followed in emphasizing the structural or systemic character of " imperialism " . such writers have expanded the time period associated with the term so that it now designates neither a policy , nor a short space of decades in the late 19th century , but a world system extending over a period of centuries , often going back to christopher columbus and , in some accounts , to the crusades . as the application of the term has expanded , its meaning has shifted along five distinct but often parallel axes : the moral , the economic , the systemic , the cultural , and the temporal . those changes reflect - among other shifts in sensibility - a growing unease , even squeamishness , with the fact of power , specifically , western power .	16	50

the concept environmental determinism served as a moral justification for domination of certain territories and peoples . it was believed that a certain person 's behaviours were determined by the environment in which they lived and thus validated their domination . for example , people living in tropical environments were seen as " less civilized " therefore justifying colonial control as a civilizing mission . across the three waves of european colonialism ( first in the americas , second in asia and lastly in africa ) , environmental determinism was used to categorically place indigenous people in a racial hierarchy . this takes two forms , orientalism and tropicality .	101	109

the basic unit of territorial division in poland is a commune ( gmina ) . a city is also a commune – but with the city charter . both cities and communes are governed by a mayor – but in the communes the mayor is vogt ( wojt in polish ) , however in the cities – burmistrz . some bigger cities obtain the entitlements , i . e . tasks and privileges , which are possessed by the units of the second level of the territorial division – counties or powiats . an example of such entitlement is a car registration : a gmina can not register cars , this is a powiat 's task ( i . e . a registration number depends on what powiat a car had been registered , not gmina ) . in this case we say about city county or powiat grodzki . such cities are for example lublin , krakow , gdansk , poznan . in warsaw , its districts additionally have some of powiat 's entitlements – like already mentioned car registration . for example , the district wola has its own evidence and the district ursynow – its own ( and the cars from wola have another type of registration number than these from ursynow ) . but for instance the districts in krakow do not have entitlements of powiat , so the registration numbers in krakow are of the same type for all districts .	59	92

the war was fought primarily along the frontiers between new france and the british colonies , from virginia in the south to nova scotia in the north . it began with a dispute over control of the confluence of the allegheny and monongahela rivers , called the forks of the ohio , and the site of the french fort duquesne and present - day pittsburgh , pennsylvania . the dispute erupted into violence in the battle of jumonville glen in may 1754 , during which virginia militiamen under the command of 22 - year - old george washington ambushed a french patrol .	28	67

in 1755 , six colonial governors in north america met with general edward braddock , the newly arrived british army commander , and planned a four - way attack on the french . none succeeded and the main effort by braddock was a disaster ; he was defeated in the battle of the monongahela on july 9 , 1755 and died a few days later . british operations in 1755 , 1756 and 1757 in the frontier areas of pennsylvania and new york all failed , due to a combination of poor management , internal divisions , and effective canadian scouts , french regular forces , and indian warrior allies . in 1755 , the british captured fort beausejour on the border separating nova scotia from acadia ; soon afterward they ordered the expulsion of the acadians . orders for the deportation were given by william shirley , commander - in - chief , north america , without direction from great britain . the acadians , both those captured in arms and those who had sworn the loyalty oath to his britannic majesty , were expelled . native americans were likewise driven off their land to make way for settlers from new england .	111	137

an early important political response to the opening of hostilities was the convening of the albany congress in june and july , 1754 . the goal of the congress was to formalize a unified front in trade and negotiations with various indians , since allegiance of the various tribes and nations was seen to be pivotal in the success in the war that was unfolding . the plan that the delegates agreed to was never ratified by the colonial legislatures nor approved of by the crown . nevertheless , the format of the congress and many specifics of the plan became the prototype for confederation during the war of independence .	0	23

the french acquired a copy of the british war plans , including the activities of shirley and johnson . shirley 's efforts to fortify oswego were bogged down in logistical difficulties , exacerbated by shirley 's inexperience in managing large expeditions . in conjunction , shirley was made aware that the french were massing for an attack on fort oswego in his absence when he planned to attack fort niagara . as a response , shirley left garrisons at oswego , fort bull , and fort williams ( the latter two located on the oneida carry between the mohawk river and wood creek at present - day rome , new york ) . supplies for use in the projected attack on niagara were cached at fort bull .	71	112

johnson 's expedition was better organized than shirley 's , which was noticed by new france 's governor , the marquis de vaudreuil . he had primarily been concerned about the extended supply line to the forts on the ohio , and had sent baron dieskau to lead the defenses at frontenac against shirley 's expected attack . when johnson was seen as the larger threat , vaudreuil sent dieskau to fort st . frederic to meet that threat . dieskau planned to attack the british encampment at fort edward at the upper end of navigation on the hudson river , but johnson had strongly fortified it , and dieskau 's indian support was reluctant to attack . the two forces finally met in the bloody battle of lake george between fort edward and fort william henry . the battle ended inconclusively , with both sides withdrawing from the field . johnson 's advance stopped at fort william henry , and the french withdrew to ticonderoga point , where they began the construction of fort carillon ( later renamed fort ticonderoga after british capture in 1759 ) .	58	79

colonel monckton , in the sole british success that year , captured fort beausejour in june 1755 , cutting the french fortress at louisbourg off from land - based reinforcements . to cut vital supplies to louisbourg , nova scotia 's governor charles lawrence ordered the deportation of the french - speaking acadian population from the area . monckton 's forces , including companies of rogers ' rangers , forcibly removed thousands of acadians , chasing down many who resisted , and sometimes committing atrocities . more than any other factor , the cutting off of supplies to louisbourg led to its demise . the acadian resistance , in concert with native allies , including the mi'kmaq , was sometimes quite stiff , with ongoing frontier raids ( against dartmouth and lunenburg among others ) . other than the campaigns to expel the acadians ( ranging around the bay of fundy , on the petitcodiac and st . john rivers , and ile saint - jean ) , the only clashes of any size were at petitcodiac in 1755 and at bloody creek near annapolis royal in 1757 .	136	188

vaudreuil and montcalm were minimally resupplied in 1758 , as the british blockade of the french coastline limited french shipping . the situation in new france was further exacerbated by a poor harvest in 1757 , a difficult winter , and the allegedly corrupt machinations of francois bigot , the intendant of the territory . his schemes to supply the colony inflated prices and were believed by montcalm to line his pockets and those of his associates . a massive outbreak of smallpox among western tribes led many of them to stay away from trading in 1758 . while many parties to the conflict blamed others ( the indians blamed the french for bringing " bad medicine " as well as denying them prizes at fort william henry ) , the disease was probably spread through the crowded conditions at william henry after the battle . montcalm focused his meager resources on the defense of the st . lawrence , with primary defenses at carillon , quebec , and louisbourg , while vaudreuil argued unsuccessfully for a continuation of the raiding tactics that had worked quite effectively in previous years .	21	54

philosophers in antiquity used the concept of force in the study of stationary and moving objects and simple machines , but thinkers such as aristotle and archimedes retained fundamental errors in understanding force . in part this was due to an incomplete understanding of the sometimes non - obvious force of friction , and a consequently inadequate view of the nature of natural motion . a fundamental error was the belief that a force is required to maintain motion , even at a constant velocity . most of the previous misunderstandings about motion and force were eventually corrected by galileo galilei and sir isaac newton . with his mathematical insight , sir isaac newton formulated laws of motion that were not improved - on for nearly three hundred years . by the early 20th century , einstein developed a theory of relativity that correctly predicted the action of forces on objects with increasing momenta near the speed of light , and also provided insight into the forces produced by gravitation and inertia .	106	129
aristotle provided a philosophical discussion of the concept of a force as an integral part of aristotelian cosmology . in aristotle 's view , the terrestrial sphere contained four elements that come to rest at different " natural places " therein . aristotle believed that motionless objects on earth , those composed mostly of the elements earth and water , to be in their natural place on the ground and that they will stay that way if left alone . he distinguished between the innate tendency of objects to find their " natural place " ( e . g . , for heavy bodies to fall ) , which led to " natural motion " , and unnatural or forced motion , which required continued application of a force . this theory , based on the everyday experience of how objects move , such as the constant application of a force needed to keep a cart moving , had conceptual trouble accounting for the behavior of projectiles , such as the flight of arrows . the place where the archer moves the projectile was at the start of the flight , and while the projectile sailed through the air , no discernible efficient cause acts on it . aristotle was aware of this problem and proposed that the air displaced through the projectile 's path carries the projectile to its target . this explanation demands a continuum like air for change of place in general .	0	18

the shortcomings of aristotelian physics would not be fully corrected until the 17th century work of galileo galilei , who was influenced by the late medieval idea that objects in forced motion carried an innate force of impetus . galileo constructed an experiment in which stones and cannonballs were both rolled down an incline to disprove the aristotelian theory of motion early in the 17th century . he showed that the bodies were accelerated by gravity to an extent that was independent of their mass and argued that objects retain their velocity unless acted on by a force , for example friction .	0	38

newton 's first law of motion states that objects continue to move in a state of constant velocity unless acted upon by an external net force or resultant force . this law is an extension of galileo 's insight that constant velocity was associated with a lack of net force ( see a more detailed description of this below ) . newton proposed that every object with mass has an innate inertia that functions as the fundamental equilibrium " natural state " in place of the aristotelian idea of the " natural state of rest " . that is , the first law contradicts the intuitive aristotelian belief that a net force is required to keep an object moving with constant velocity . by making rest physically indistinguishable from non - zero constant velocity , newton 's first law directly connects inertia with the concept of relative velocities . specifically , in systems where objects are moving with different velocities , it is impossible to determine which object is " in motion " and which object is " at rest " . in other words , to phrase matters more technically , the laws of physics are the same in every inertial frame of reference , that is , in all frames related by a galilean transformation .	123	148
the concept of inertia can be further generalized to explain the tendency of objects to continue in many different forms of constant motion , even those that are not strictly constant velocity . the rotational inertia of planet earth is what fixes the constancy of the length of a day and the length of a year . albert einstein extended the principle of inertia further when he explained that reference frames subject to constant acceleration , such as those free - falling toward a gravitating object , were physically equivalent to inertial reference frames . this is why , for example , astronauts experience weightlessness when in free - fall orbit around the earth , and why newton 's laws of motion are more easily discernible in such environments . if an astronaut places an object with mass in mid - air next to himself , it will remain stationary with respect to the astronaut due to its inertia . this is the same thing that would occur if the astronaut and the object were in intergalactic space with no net force of gravity acting on their shared reference frame . this principle of equivalence was one of the foundational underpinnings for the development of the general theory of relativity .	95	129

newton 's second law asserts the direct proportionality of acceleration to force and the inverse proportionality of acceleration to mass . accelerations can be defined through kinematic measurements . however , while kinematics are well - described through reference frame analysis in advanced physics , there are still deep questions that remain as to what is the proper definition of mass . general relativity offers an equivalence between space - time and mass , but lacking a coherent theory of quantum gravity , it is unclear as to how or whether this connection is relevant on microscales . with some justification , newton 's second law can be taken as a quantitative definition of mass by writing the law as an equality ; the relative units of force and mass then are fixed .	21	28
since forces are perceived as pushes or pulls , this can provide an intuitive understanding for describing forces . as with other physical concepts ( e . g . temperature ) , the intuitive understanding of forces is quantified using precise operational definitions that are consistent with direct observations and compared to a standard measurement scale . through experimentation , it is determined that laboratory measurements of forces are fully consistent with the conceptual definition of force offered by newtonian mechanics .	57	81
historically , forces were first quantitatively investigated in conditions of static equilibrium where several forces canceled each other out . such experiments demonstrate the crucial properties that forces are additive vector quantities : they have magnitude and direction . when two forces act on a point particle , the resulting force , the resultant ( also called the net force ) , can be determined by following the parallelogram rule of vector addition : the addition of two vectors represented by sides of a parallelogram , gives an equivalent resultant vector that is equal in magnitude and direction to the transversal of the parallelogram . the magnitude of the resultant varies from the difference of the magnitudes of the two forces to their sum , depending on the angle between their lines of action . however , if the forces are acting on an extended body , their respective lines of application must also be specified in order to account for their effects on the motion of the body .	135	169
as well as being added , forces can also be resolved into independent components at right angles to each other . a horizontal force pointing northeast can therefore be split into two forces , one pointing north , and one pointing east . summing these component forces using vector addition yields the original force . resolving force vectors into components of a set of basis vectors is often a more mathematically clean way to describe forces than using magnitudes and directions . this is because , for orthogonal components , the components of the vector sum are uniquely determined by the scalar addition of the components of the individual vectors . orthogonal components are independent of each other because forces acting at ninety degrees to each other have no effect on the magnitude or direction of the other . choosing a set of orthogonal basis vectors is often done by considering what set of basis vectors will make the mathematics most convenient . choosing a basis vector that is in the same direction as one of the forces is desirable , since that force would then have only one non - zero component . orthogonal force vectors can be three - dimensional with the third component being at right - angles to the other two .	21	42
a static equilibrium between two forces is the most usual way of measuring forces , using simple devices such as weighing scales and spring balances . for example , an object suspended on a vertical spring scale experiences the force of gravity acting on the object balanced by a force applied by the " spring reaction force " , which equals the object 's weight . using such tools , some quantitative force laws were discovered : that the force of gravity is proportional to volume for objects of constant density ( widely exploited for millennia to define standard weights ) ; archimedes ' principle for buoyancy ; archimedes ' analysis of the lever ; boyle 's law for gas pressure ; and hooke 's law for springs . these were all formulated and experimentally verified before isaac newton expounded his three laws of motion .	0	25

dynamic equilibrium was first described by galileo who noticed that certain assumptions of aristotelian physics were contradicted by observations and logic . galileo realized that simple velocity addition demands that the concept of an " absolute rest frame " did not exist . galileo concluded that motion in a constant velocity was completely equivalent to rest . this was contrary to aristotle 's notion of a " natural state " of rest that objects with mass naturally approached . simple experiments showed that galileo 's understanding of the equivalence of constant velocity and rest were correct . for example , if a mariner dropped a cannonball from the crow 's nest of a ship moving at a constant velocity , aristotelian physics would have the cannonball fall straight down while the ship moved beneath it . thus , in an aristotelian universe , the falling cannonball would land behind the foot of the mast of a moving ship . however , when this experiment is actually conducted , the cannonball always falls at the foot of the mast , as if the cannonball knows to travel with the ship despite being separated from it . since there is no forward horizontal force being applied on the cannonball as it falls , the only conclusion left is that the cannonball continues to move with the same velocity as the boat as it falls . thus , no force is required to keep the cannonball moving at the constant forward velocity .	43	56
a simple case of dynamic equilibrium occurs in constant velocity motion across a surface with kinetic friction . in such a situation , a force is applied in the direction of motion while the kinetic friction force exactly opposes the applied force . this results in zero net force , but since the object started with a non - zero velocity , it continues to move with a non - zero velocity . aristotle misinterpreted this motion as being caused by the applied force . however , when kinetic friction is taken into consideration it is clear that there is no net force causing constant velocity motion .	85	107
the notion " force " keeps its meaning in quantum mechanics , though one is now dealing with operators instead of classical variables and though the physics is now described by the schrodinger equation instead of newtonian equations . this has the consequence that the results of a measurement are now sometimes " quantized " , i . e . they appear in discrete portions . this is , of course , difficult to imagine in the context of " forces " . however , the potentials v ( x , y , z ) or fields , from which the forces generally can be derived , are treated similar to classical position variables , i . e . , .	0	38
however , already in quantum mechanics there is one " caveat " , namely the particles acting onto each other do not only possess the spatial variable , but also a discrete intrinsic angular momentum - like variable called the " spin " , and there is the pauli principle relating the space and the spin variables . depending on the value of the spin , identical particles split into two different classes , fermions and bosons . if two identical fermions ( e . g . electrons ) have a symmetric spin function ( e . g . parallel spins ) the spatial variables must be antisymmetric ( i . e . they exclude each other from their places much as if there was a repulsive force ) , and vice versa , i . e . for antiparallel spins the position variables must be symmetric ( i . e . the apparent force must be attractive ) . thus in the case of two fermions there is a strictly negative correlation between spatial and spin variables , whereas for two bosons ( e . g . quanta of electromagnetic waves , photons ) the correlation is strictly positive .	58	77

in modern particle physics , forces and the acceleration of particles are explained as a mathematical by - product of exchange of momentum - carrying gauge bosons . with the development of quantum field theory and general relativity , it was realized that force is a redundant concept arising from conservation of momentum ( 4 - momentum in relativity and momentum of virtual particles in quantum electrodynamics ) . the conservation of momentum can be directly derived from the homogeneity or symmetry of space and so is usually considered more fundamental than the concept of a force . thus the currently known fundamental forces are considered more accurately to be " fundamental interactions " . : 199 – 128 when particle a emits ( creates ) or absorbs ( annihilates ) virtual particle b , a momentum conservation results in recoil of particle a making impression of repulsion or attraction between particles a a ' exchanging by b . this description applies to all forces arising from fundamental interactions . while sophisticated mathematical descriptions are needed to predict , in full detail , the accurate result of such interactions , there is a conceptually simple way to describe such interactions through the use of feynman diagrams . in a feynman diagram , each matter particle is represented as a straight line ( see world line ) traveling through time , which normally increases up or to the right in the diagram . matter and anti - matter particles are identical except for their direction of propagation through the feynman diagram . world lines of particles intersect at interaction vertices , and the feynman diagram represents any force arising from an interaction as occurring at the vertex with an associated instantaneous change in the direction of the particle world lines . gauge bosons are emitted away from the vertex as wavy lines and , in the case of virtual particle exchange , are absorbed at an adjacent vertex .	69	97
all of the forces in the universe are based on four fundamental interactions . the strong and weak forces are nuclear forces that act only at very short distances , and are responsible for the interactions between subatomic particles , including nucleons and compound nuclei . the electromagnetic force acts between electric charges , and the gravitational force acts between masses . all other forces in nature derive from these four fundamental interactions . for example , friction is a manifestation of the electromagnetic force acting between the atoms of two surfaces , and the pauli exclusion principle , which does not permit atoms to pass through each other . similarly , the forces in springs , modeled by hooke 's law , are the result of electromagnetic forces and the exclusion principle acting together to return an object to its equilibrium position . centrifugal forces are acceleration forces that arise simply from the acceleration of rotating frames of reference . : 12 - 11 : 359	0	13
the development of fundamental theories for forces proceeded along the lines of unification of disparate ideas . for example , isaac newton unified the force responsible for objects falling at the surface of the earth with the force responsible for the orbits of celestial mechanics in his universal theory of gravitation . michael faraday and james clerk maxwell demonstrated that electric and magnetic forces were unified through one consistent theory of electromagnetism . in the 20th century , the development of quantum mechanics led to a modern understanding that the first three fundamental forces ( all except gravity ) are manifestations of matter ( fermions ) interacting by exchanging virtual particles called gauge bosons . this standard model of particle physics posits a similarity between the forces and led scientists to predict the unification of the weak and electromagnetic forces in electroweak theory subsequently confirmed by observation . the complete formulation of the standard model predicts an as yet unobserved higgs mechanism , but observations such as neutrino oscillations indicate that the standard model is incomplete . a grand unified theory allowing for the combination of the electroweak interaction with the strong force is held out as a possibility with candidate theories such as supersymmetry proposed to accommodate some of the outstanding unsolved problems in physics . physicists are still attempting to develop self - consistent unification models that would combine all four fundamental interactions into a theory of everything . einstein tried and failed at this endeavor , but currently the most popular approach to answering this question is string theory . : 212 – 219	17	51
newton came to realize that the effects of gravity might be observed in different ways at larger distances . in particular , newton determined that the acceleration of the moon around the earth could be ascribed to the same force of gravity if the acceleration due to gravity decreased as an inverse square law . further , newton realized that the acceleration due to gravity is proportional to the mass of the attracting body . combining these ideas gives a formula that relates the mass ( ) and the radius ( ) of the earth to the gravitational acceleration :	55	74
in this equation , a dimensional constant is used to describe the relative strength of gravity . this constant has come to be known as newton 's universal gravitation constant , though its value was unknown in newton 's lifetime . not until 1798 was henry cavendish able to make the first measurement of using a torsion balance ; this was widely reported in the press as a measurement of the mass of the earth since knowing could allow one to solve for the earth 's mass given the above equation . newton , however , realized that since all celestial bodies followed the same laws of motion , his law of gravity had to be universal . succinctly stated , newton 's law of gravitation states that the force on a spherical object of mass due to the gravitational pull of mass is	92	117

since then , and so far , general relativity has been acknowledged as the theory that best explains gravity . in gr , gravitation is not viewed as a force , but rather , objects moving freely in gravitational fields travel under their own inertia in straight lines through curved space - time – defined as the shortest space - time path between two space - time events . from the perspective of the object , all motion occurs as if there were no gravitation whatsoever . it is only when observing the motion in a global sense that the curvature of space - time can be observed and the force is inferred from the object 's curved path . thus , the straight line path in space - time is seen as a curved line in space , and it is called the ballistic trajectory of the object . for example , a basketball thrown from the ground moves in a parabola , as it is in a uniform gravitational field . its space - time trajectory ( when the extra ct dimension is added ) is almost a straight line , slightly curved ( with the radius of curvature of the order of few light - years ) . the time derivative of the changing momentum of the object is what we label as " gravitational force " .	0	19
through combining the definition of electric current as the time rate of change of electric charge , a rule of vector multiplication called lorentz 's law describes the force on a charge moving in a magnetic field . the connection between electricity and magnetism allows for the description of a unified electromagnetic force that acts on a charge . this force can be written as a sum of the electrostatic force ( due to the electric field ) and the magnetic force ( due to the magnetic field ) . fully stated , this is the law :	0	37
the origin of electric and magnetic fields would not be fully explained until 1864 when james clerk maxwell unified a number of earlier theories into a set of 20 scalar equations , which were later reformulated into 4 vector equations by oliver heaviside and josiah willard gibbs . these " maxwell equations " fully described the sources of the fields as being stationary and moving charges , and the interactions of the fields themselves . this led maxwell to discover that electric and magnetic fields could be " self - generating " through a wave that traveled at a speed that he calculated to be the speed of light . this insight united the nascent fields of electromagnetic theory with optics and led directly to a complete description of the electromagnetic spectrum .	0	47

the strong force only acts directly upon elementary particles . however , a residual of the force is observed between hadrons ( the best known example being the force that acts between nucleons in atomic nuclei ) as the nuclear force . here the strong force acts indirectly , transmitted as gluons , which form part of the virtual pi and rho mesons , which classically transmit the nuclear force ( see this topic for more ) . the failure of many searches for free quarks has shown that the elementary particles affected are not directly observable . this phenomenon is called color confinement .	0	9
newton 's laws and newtonian mechanics in general were first developed to describe how forces affect idealized point particles rather than three - dimensional objects . however , in real life , matter has extended structure and forces that act on one part of an object might affect other parts of an object . for situations where lattice holding together the atoms in an object is able to flow , contract , expand , or otherwise change shape , the theories of continuum mechanics describe the way forces affect the material . for example , in extended fluids , differences in pressure result in forces being directed along the pressure gradients as follows :	26	53
where is the relevant cross - sectional area for the volume for which the stress - tensor is being calculated . this formalism includes pressure terms associated with forces that act normal to the cross - sectional area ( the matrix diagonals of the tensor ) as well as shear terms associated with forces that act parallel to the cross - sectional area ( the off - diagonal elements ) . the stress tensor accounts for forces that cause all strains ( deformations ) including also tensile stresses and compressions . : 133 – 134 : 38 - 1 – 38 - 11	21	70

where is the mass of the object , is the velocity of the object and is the distance to the center of the circular path and is the unit vector pointing in the radial direction outwards from the center . this means that the unbalanced centripetal force felt by any object is always directed toward the center of the curving path . such forces act perpendicular to the velocity vector associated with the motion of an object , and therefore do not change the speed of the object ( magnitude of the velocity ) , but only the direction of the velocity vector . the unbalanced force that accelerates an object can be resolved into a component that is perpendicular to the path , and one that is tangential to the path . this yields both the tangential force , which accelerates the object by either slowing it down or speeding it up , and the radial ( centripetal ) force , which changes its direction .	40	61
for certain physical scenarios , it is impossible to model forces as being due to gradient of potentials . this is often due to macrophysical considerations that yield forces as arising from a macroscopic statistical average of microstates . for example , friction is caused by the gradients of numerous electrostatic potentials between the atoms , but manifests as a force model that is independent of any macroscale position vector . nonconservative forces other than friction include other contact forces , tension , compression , and drag . however , for any sufficiently detailed description , all these forces are the results of conservative ones since each of these macroscopic forces are the net results of the gradients of microscopic potentials .	0	18
the connection between macroscopic nonconservative forces and microscopic conservative forces is described by detailed treatment with statistical mechanics . in macroscopic closed systems , nonconservative forces act to change the internal energies of the system , and are often associated with the transfer of heat . according to the second law of thermodynamics , nonconservative forces necessarily result in energy transformations within closed systems from ordered to more random conditions as entropy increases .	19	45

the pound - force has a metric counterpart , less commonly used than the newton : the kilogram - force ( kgf ) ( sometimes kilopond ) , is the force exerted by standard gravity on one kilogram of mass . the kilogram - force leads to an alternate , but rarely used unit of mass : the metric slug ( sometimes mug or hyl ) is that mass that accelerates at 1 m · s−2 when subjected to a force of 1 kgf . the kilogram - force is not a part of the modern si system , and is generally deprecated ; however it still sees use for some purposes as expressing aircraft weight , jet thrust , bicycle spoke tension , torque wrench settings and engine output torque . other arcane units of force include the sthene , which is equivalent to 1000 n , and the kip , which is equivalent to 1000 lbf .	0	40
