rajasthan ( / ˈrɑːdʒəstæn / hindustani pronunciation : [ raːdʒəsˈtʰaːn ] ( listen ) ; literally , " land of kings " ) is india 's largest state by area ( 342 , 239 square kilometres ( 132 , 139 sq mi ) or 10 . 4 % of india 's total area ) . it is located on the western side of the country , where it comprises most of the wide and inhospitable thar desert ( also known as the " rajasthan desert " and " great indian desert " ) and shares a border with the pakistani provinces of punjab to the northwest and sindh to the west , along the sutlej - indus river valley . elsewhere it is bordered by the other indian states : punjab to the north ; haryana and uttar pradesh to the northeast ; madhya pradesh to the southeast ; and gujarat to the southwest . its features include the ruins of the indus valley civilization at kalibanga ; the dilwara temples , a jain pilgrimage site at rajasthan 's only hill station , mount abu , in the ancient aravalli mountain range ; and , in eastern rajasthan , the keoladeo national park near bharatpur , a world heritage site known for its bird life . rajasthan is also home to two national tiger reserves , the ranthambore national park in sawai madhopur and sariska tiger reserve in alwar .	0	54
the first mention of the name " rajasthan " appears in james tod 's 1829 publication annals and antiquities of rajast'han or the central and western rajpoot states of india , while the earliest known record of " rajputana " as a name for the region is in george thomas 's 1800 memoir military memories . john keay , in his book india : a history , stated that " rajputana " was coined by the british in 1829 , john briggs , translating ferishta 's history of early islamic india , used the phrase " rajpoot ( rajput ) princes " rather than " indian princes " .	0	55

in the early days of association football , known simply as football or soccer , friendly matches ( or " friendlies " ) were the most common type of match . however , since the development of the football league in england in 1888 , league tournaments became established , in addition to lengthy derby and cup tournaments . by the year 2000 , national leagues were established in almost every country throughout the world , as well as local or regional leagues for lower level teams , thus the significance of friendlies has seriously declined since the 19th century .	59	100

since the introduction of league football , most club sides play a number of friendlies before the start of each season ( called pre - season friendlies ) . friendly football matches are considered to be non - competitive and are only used to " warm up " players for a new season / competitive match . there is generally nothing competitive at stake and some rules may be changed or experimented with ( such as unlimited substitutions , which allow teams to play younger , less experienced , players , and no cards ) . although most friendlies are simply one - off matches arranged by the clubs themselves , in which a certain amount is paid by the challenger club to the incumbent club , some teams do compete in short tournaments , such as the emirates cup , teresa herrera trophy and the amsterdam tournament . although these events may involve sponsorship deals and the awarding of a trophy and may even be broadcast on television , there is little prestige attached to them .	0	28
international teams also play friendlies , generally in preparation for the qualifying or final stages of major tournaments . this is essential , since national squads generally have much less time together in which to prepare . the biggest difference between friendlies at the club and international levels is that international friendlies mostly take place during club league seasons , not between them . this has on occasion led to disagreement between national associations and clubs as to the availability of players , who could become injured or fatigued in a friendly .	19	36
international friendlies give team managers the opportunity to experiment with team selection and tactics before the tournament proper , and also allow them to assess the abilities of players they may potentially select for the tournament squad . players can be booked in international friendlies , and can be suspended from future international matches based on red cards or accumulated yellows in a specified period . caps and goals scored also count towards a player 's career records . in 2004 , fifa ruled that substitutions by a team be limited to six per match in international friendlies , in response to criticism that such matches were becoming increasingly farcical with managers making as many as 11 substitutions per match .	0	37
in the uk and ireland , " exhibition match " and " friendly match " refer to two different types of matches . the types described above as friendlies are not termed exhibition matches , while annual all - star matches such as those held in the us major league soccer or japan 's japanese league are called exhibition matches rather than friendly matches . a one - off match for charitable fundraising , usually involving one or two all - star teams , or a match held in honor of a player for contribution to his / her club , may also be described as exhibition matches but they are normally referred to as charity matches and testimonial matches respectively .	0	22

compared to other team sports , the national football league preseason is very structured . every nfl team plays exactly four pre - season exhibition games a year , two at home and two away , with the exception of two teams each year who play a fifth game , the pro football hall of fame game . these exhibition games , most of which are held in the month of august , are played for the purpose of helping coaches narrow down the roster from the offseason limit of 90 players to the regular - season limit of 53 players . while the scheduling formula is not as rigid for preseason games as they are for the regular season , there are numerous restrictions and traditions that limit the choices of preseason opponents ; teams are also restricted on what days and times they can play these games . split - squad games , a practice common in baseball and hockey , where a team that is scheduled to play two games on the same day splits their team into two squads , are prohibited . the nfl has played exhibition games in europe , japan , canada , australia ( including the american bowl in 1999 ) and mexico to spread the league 's popularity ( a game of this type was proposed for china but , due to financial and logistical problems , was eventually canceled ) . the league has tacitly forbidden the playing of non - league opponents , with the last interleague game having come in 1972 and the last game against a team other than an nfl team ( the all - nfl rookie college all - stars ) was held in 1976 . exhibition games are quite unpopular with many fans , who resent having to pay regular - season prices for two home exhibition games as part of a season - ticket package . numerous lawsuits have been brought by fans and classes of fans against the nfl or its member teams regarding this practice , but none have been successful in halting it . [ citation needed ] the pro bowl , traditionally played after the end of the nfl season ( since 2011 is played the week prior to the super bowl ) , is also considered an exhibition game .	15	57
the arena football league briefly had a two - game exhibition season in the early 2000s , a practice that ended in 2003 with a new television contract . exhibition games outside of a structured season are relatively common among indoor american football leagues ; because teams switch leagues frequently at that level of play , it is not uncommon to see some of the smaller leagues schedule exhibition games against teams that are from another league , about to join the league as a probational franchise , or a semi - pro outdoor team to fill holes in a schedule .	29	101
true exhibition games between opposing colleges at the highest level do not exist in college football ; due to the importance of opinion polling in the top level of college football , even exhibition games would not truly be exhibitions because they could influence the opinions of those polled . intramural games are possible because a team playing against itself leaves little ability for poll participants to make judgments , and at levels below the football bowl subdivision ( fbs ) , championships are decided by objective formulas and thus those teams can play non - league games without affecting their playoff hopes .	0	49
however , most of the major fbs teams annually schedule early season non - conference preseason home games against lesser opponents that are lower - tier fbs , football championship , or division ii schools , which often result in lopsided victories in favor of the fbs teams and act as exhibition games in all but name , though they additionally provide a large appearance fee and at least one guaranteed television appearance for the smaller school . these games also receive the same criticism as nfl exhibition games , but instead it is targeted to schools scheduling low - quality opponents and the simplicity for a team to run up the score against a weak opponent . however , these games are susceptible to backfiring , resulting in damage in poll position and public perception , especially if the higher ranked team loses , although the mere act of scheduling a weak opponent is harmful to a team 's overall strength of schedule itself . games an fbs team schedules against lower division opponents do not count toward the minimum seven wins required for bowl eligibility , and only one game against an fcs team can be counted . with the start of the college football playoff system for the 2014 season , major teams are now discouraged from scheduling weaker opponents for their non - conference schedule because of a much higher emphasis on strength of schedule than in the bowl championship series era .	166	199

various auto racing organizations hold exhibition events ; these events usually award no championship points to participants , but they do offer prize money to participants . the nascar sprint cup series holds two exhibition events annually - the sprint unlimited , held at daytona international speedway at the start of the season , and the nascar sprint all - star race , held at charlotte motor speedway midway through the season . both events carry a hefty purse of over usd $ 1 , 000 , 000 . nascar has also held exhibition races at suzuka circuit and twin ring motegi in japan and calder park thunderdome in australia .	27	72
burke was born in dublin , ireland . his mother mary nee nagle ( c . 1702 – 1770 ) was a roman catholic who hailed from a declasse county cork family ( and a cousin of nano nagle ) , whereas his father , a successful solicitor , richard ( died 1761 ) , was a member of the church of ireland ; it remains unclear whether this is the same richard burke who converted from catholicism . the burke dynasty descends from an anglo - norman knight surnamed de burgh ( latinised as de burgo ) who arrived in ireland in 1185 following henry ii of england 's 1171 invasion of ireland .	0	7
in 1744 , burke started at trinity college dublin , a protestant establishment , which up until 1793 , did not permit catholics to take degrees . in 1747 , he set up a debating society , " edmund burke 's club " , which , in 1770 , merged with tcd 's historical club to form the college historical society ; it is the oldest undergraduate society in the world . the minutes of the meetings of burke 's club remain in the collection of the historical society . burke graduated from trinity in 1748 . burke 's father wanted him to read law , and with this in mind he went to london in 1750 , where he entered the middle temple , before soon giving up legal study to travel in continental europe . after eschewing the law , he pursued a livelihood through writing .	35	71

richard hurd believed that burke 's imitation was near - perfect and that this defeated his purpose : an ironist " should take care by a constant exaggeration to make the ridicule shine through the imitation . whereas this vindication is everywhere enforc'd , not only in the language , and on the principles of l . bol . , but with so apparent , or rather so real an earnestness , that half his purpose is sacrificed to the other " . a minority of scholars have taken the position that , in fact , burke did write the vindication in earnest , later disowning it only for political reasons .	83	111

on 25 february 1757 , burke signed a contract with robert dodsley to write a " history of england from the time of julius caesar to the end of the reign of queen anne " , its length being eighty quarto sheets ( 640 pages ) , nearly 400 , 000 words . it was to be submitted for publication by christmas 1758 . burke completed the work to the year 1216 and stopped ; it was not published until after burke 's death , being included in an 1812 collection of his works , entitled an essay towards an abridgement of the english history . g . m . young did not value burke 's history and claimed that it was " demonstrably a translation from the french " . lord acton , on commenting on the story that burke stopped his history because david hume published his , said " it is ever to be regretted that the reverse did not occur " .	64	105
during the year following that contract , with dodsley , burke founded the influential annual register , a publication in which various authors evaluated the international political events of the previous year . the extent to which burke contributed to the annual register is unclear : in his biography of burke , robert murray quotes the register as evidence of burke 's opinions , yet philip magnus in his biography does not cite it directly as a reference . burke remained the chief editor of the publication until at least 1789 and there is no evidence that any other writer contributed to it before 1766 .	33	78

at about this same time , burke was introduced to william gerard hamilton ( known as " single - speech hamilton " ) . when hamilton was appointed chief secretary for ireland , burke accompanied him to dublin as his private secretary , a position he held for three years . in 1765 burke became private secretary to the liberal whig statesman , charles , marquess of rockingham , then prime minister of great britain , who remained burke 's close friend and associate until his untimely death in 1782 . rockingham also introduced burke as a freemason .	0	23

in may 1778 , burke supported a parliamentary motion revising restrictions on irish trade . his constituents , citizens of the great trading city of bristol , however urged burke to oppose free trade with ireland . burke resisted their protestations and said : " if , from this conduct , i shall forfeit their suffrages at an ensuing election , it will stand on record an example to future representatives of the commons of england , that one man at least had dared to resist the desires of his constituents when his judgment assured him they were wrong " .	15	36

burke was not merely presenting a peace agreement to parliament ; rather , he stepped forward with four reasons against using force , carefully reasoned . he laid out his objections in an orderly manner , focusing on one before moving to the next . his first concern was that the use of force would have to be temporary , and that the uprisings and objections to british governance in america would not be . second , burke worried about the uncertainty surrounding whether britain would win a conflict in america . " an armament " , burke said , " is not a victory " . third , burke brought up the issue of impairment ; it would do the british government no good to engage in a scorched earth war and have the object they desired ( america ) become damaged or even useless . the american colonists could always retreat into the mountains , but the land they left behind would most likely be unusable , whether by accident or design . the fourth and final reason to avoid the use of force was experience ; the british had never attempted to rein in an unruly colony by force , and they did not know if it could be done , let alone accomplished thousands of miles away from home . not only were all of these concerns reasonable , but some turned out to be prophetic – the american colonists did not surrender , even when things looked extremely bleak , and the british were ultimately unsuccessful in their attempts to win a war fought on american soil .	0	25

among the reasons this speech was so greatly admired was its passage on lord bathurst ( 1684 – 1775 ) ; burke describes an angel in 1704 prophesying to bathurst the future greatness of england and also of america : " young man , there is america – which at this day serves little more than to amuse you with stories of savage men , and uncouth manners ; yet shall , before you taste of death , shew itself equal to the whole of that commerce which now attracts the envy of the world " . samuel johnson was so irritated at hearing it continually praised , that he made a parody of it , where the devil appears to a young whig and predicts that in short time , whiggism will poison even the paradise of america !	0	96

burke was a leading sceptic with respect to democracy . while admitting that theoretically , in some cases it might be desirable , he insisted a democratic government in britain in his day would not only be inept , but also oppressive . he opposed democracy for three basic reasons . first , government required a degree of intelligence and breadth of knowledge of the sort that occurred rarely among the common people . second , he thought that if they had the vote , common people had dangerous and angry passions that could be aroused easily by demagogues ; he feared that the authoritarian impulses that could be empowered by these passions would undermine cherished traditions and established religion , leading to violence and confiscation of property . third , burke warned that democracy would create a tyranny over unpopular minorities , who needed the protection of the upper classes .	129	151

initially , burke did not condemn the french revolution . in a letter of 9 august 1789 , burke wrote : " england gazing with astonishment at a french struggle for liberty and not knowing whether to blame or to applaud ! the thing indeed , though i thought i saw something like it in progress for several years , has still something in it paradoxical and mysterious . the spirit it is impossible not to admire ; but the old parisian ferocity has broken out in a shocking manner " . the events of 5 – 6 october 1789 , when a crowd of parisian women marched on versailles to compel king louis xvi to return to paris , turned burke against it . in a letter to his son , richard burke , dated 10 october he said : " this day i heard from laurence who has sent me papers confirming the portentous state of france — where the elements which compose human society seem all to be dissolved , and a world of monsters to be produced in the place of it — where mirabeau presides as the grand anarch ; and the late grand monarch makes a figure as ridiculous as pitiable " . on 4 november charles - jean - francois depont wrote to burke , requesting that he endorse the revolution . burke replied that any critical language of it by him should be taken " as no more than the expression of doubt " but he added : " you may have subverted monarchy , but not recover'd freedom " . in the same month he described france as " a country undone " . burke 's first public condemnation of the revolution occurred on the debate in parliament on the army estimates on 9 february 1790 , provoked by praise of the revolution by pitt and fox :	283	316

in january 1790 , burke read dr . richard price 's sermon of 4 november 1789 entitled , a discourse on the love of our country , to the revolution society . that society had been founded to commemorate the glorious revolution of 1688 . in this sermon price espoused the philosophy of universal " rights of men " . price argued that love of our country " does not imply any conviction of the superior value of it to other countries , or any particular preference of its laws and constitution of government " . instead , price asserted that englishmen should see themselves " more as citizens of the world than as members of any particular community " .	0	31
immediately after reading price 's sermon , burke wrote a draft of what eventually became , reflections on the revolution in france . on 13 february 1790 , a notice in the press said that shortly , burke would publish a pamphlet on the revolution and its british supporters , however he spent the year revising and expanding it . on 1 november he finally published the reflections and it was an immediate best - seller . priced at five shillings , it was more expensive than most political pamphlets , but by the end of 1790 , it had gone through ten printings and sold approximately 17 , 500 copies . a french translation appeared on 29 november and on 30 november the translator , pierre - gaeton dupont , wrote to burke saying 2 , 500 copies had already been sold . the french translation ran to ten printings by june 1791 .	112	143

burke put forward that " we fear god , we look up with awe to kings ; with affection to parliaments ; with duty to magistrates ; with reverence to priests ; and with respect to nobility . why ? because when such ideas are brought before our minds , it is natural to be so affected " . burke defended this prejudice on the grounds that it is " the general bank and capital of nations , and of ages " and superior to individual reason , which is small in comparison . " prejudice " , burke claimed , " is of ready application in the emergency ; it previously engages the mind in a steady course of wisdom and virtue , and does not leave the man hesitating in the moment of decision , skeptical , puzzled , and unresolved . prejudice renders a man 's virtue his habit " . burke criticised social contract theory by claiming that society is indeed , a contract , but " a partnership not only between those who are living , but between those who are living , those who are dead , and those who are to be born " .	0	37
the most famous passage in burke 's reflections was his description of the events of 5 – 6 october 1789 and the part of marie - antoinette in them . burke 's account differs little from modern historians who have used primary sources . his use of flowery language to describe it , however , provoked both praise and criticism . philip francis wrote to burke saying that what he wrote of marie - antoinette was " pure foppery " . edward gibbon , however , reacted differently : " i adore his chivalry " . burke was informed by an englishman who had talked with the duchesse de biron , that when marie - antoinette was reading the passage , she burst into tears and took considerable time to finish reading it . price had rejoiced that the french king had been " led in triumph " during the october days , but to burke this symbolised the opposing revolutionary sentiment of the jacobins and the natural sentiments of those who shared his own view with horror — that the ungallant assault on marie - antoinette — was a cowardly attack on a defenceless woman .	96	133

burke 's reflections sparked a pamphlet war . thomas paine penned the rights of man in 1791 as a response to burke ; mary wollstonecraft published a vindication of the rights of men and james mackintosh wrote vindiciae gallicae . mackintosh was the first to see the reflections as " the manifesto of a counter revolution " . mackintosh later agreed with burke 's views , remarking in december 1796 after meeting him , that burke was " minutely and accurately informed , to a wonderful exactness , with respect to every fact relating to the french revolution " . mackintosh later said : " burke was one of the first thinkers as well as one of the greatest orators of his time . he is without parallel in any age , excepting perhaps lord bacon and cicero ; and his works contain an ampler store of political and moral wisdom than can be found in any other writer whatever " .	124	161
in november 1790 , francois - louis - thibault de menonville , a member of the national assembly of france , wrote to burke , praising reflections and requesting more " very refreshing mental food " that he could publish . this burke did in april 1791 when he published a letter to a member of the national assembly . burke called for external forces to reverse the revolution and included an attack on the late french philosopher jean - jacques rousseau , as being the subject of a personality cult that had developed in revolutionary france . although burke conceded that rousseau sometimes showed " a considerable insight into human nature " he mostly was critical . although he did not meet rousseau on his visit to britain in 1766 – 7 burke was a friend of david hume , with whom rousseau had stayed . burke said rousseau " entertained no principle either to influence of his heart , or to guide his understanding — but vanity " — which he " was possessed to a degree little short of madness " . he also cited rousseau 's confessions as evidence that rousseau had a life of " obscure and vulgar vices " that was not " chequered , or spotted here and there , with virtues , or even distinguished by a single good action " . burke contrasted rousseau 's theory of universal benevolence and his having sent his children to a foundling hospital : " a lover of his kind , but a hater of his kindred " .	41	59
at this point , fox whispered that there was " no loss of friendship " . " i regret to say there is " , burke replied , " i have indeed made a great sacrifice ; i have done my duty though i have lost my friend . there is something in the detested french constitution that envenoms every thing it touches " . this provoked a reply from fox , yet he was unable to give his speech for some time since he was overcome with tears and emotion , he appealed to burke to remember their inalienable friendship , but also repeated his criticisms of burke and uttered " unusually bitter sarcasms " . this only aggravated the rupture between the two men . burke demonstrated his separation from the party on 5 june 1791 by writing to fitzwilliam , declining money from him .	127	147

burke knew that many members of the whig party did not share fox 's views and he wanted to provoke them into condemning the french revolution . burke wrote that he wanted to represent the whole whig party " as tolerating , and by a toleration , countenancing those proceedings " so that he could " stimulate them to a public declaration of what every one of their acquaintance privately knows to be . . . their sentiments " . therefore , on 3 august 1791 burke published his appeal from the new to the old whigs , in which he renewed his criticism of the radical revolutionary programmes inspired by the french revolution and attacked the whigs who supported them , as holding principles contrary to those traditionally held by the whig party .	0	26

although whig grandees such as portland and fitzwilliam privately agreed with burke 's appeal , they wished he had used more moderate language . fitzwilliam saw the appeal as containing " the doctrines i have sworn by , long and long since " . francis basset , a backbench whig mp , wrote to burke : " . . . though for reasons which i will not now detail i did not then deliver my sentiments , i most perfectly differ from mr . fox & from the great body of opposition on the french revolution " . burke sent a copy of the appeal to the king and the king requested a friend to communicate to burke that he had read it " with great satisfaction " . burke wrote of its reception : " not one word from one of our party . they are secretly galled . they agree with me to a title ; but they dare not speak out for fear of hurting fox . . . . they leave me to myself ; they see that i can do myself justice " . charles burney viewed it as " a most admirable book — the best & most useful on political subjects that i have ever seen " but believed the differences in the whig party between burke and fox should not be aired publicly .	189	231

burke supported the war against revolutionary france , seeing britain as fighting on the side of the royalists and emigres in a civil war , rather than fighting against the whole nation of france . burke also supported the royalist uprising in la vendee , describing it on 4 november 1793 in a letter to william windham , as " the sole affair i have much heart in " . burke wrote to henry dundas on 7 october urging him to send reinforcements there , as he viewed it as the only theatre in the war that might lead to a march on paris . dundas did not follow burke 's advice , however .	35	69

burke believed the government was not taking the uprising seriously enough , a view reinforced by a letter he had received from the prince charles of france ( s . a . r . le comte d'artois ) , dated 23 october , requesting that he intercede on behalf of the royalists to the government . burke was forced to reply on 6 november : " i am not in his majesty 's service ; or at all consulted in his affairs " . burke published his remarks on the policy of the allies with respect to france , begun in october , where he said : " i am sure every thing has shewn us that in this war with france , one frenchman is worth twenty foreigners . la vendee is a proof of this " .	130	138
on 20 june 1794 , burke received a vote of thanks from the commons for his services in the hastings trial and he immediately resigned his seat , being replaced by his son richard . a tragic blow fell upon burke with the loss of richard in august 1794 , to whom he was tenderly attached , and in whom he saw signs of promise , which were not patent to others and which , in fact , appear to have been non - existent ( though this view may have rather reflected the fact that richard burke had worked successfully in the early battle for catholic emancipation ) . king george iii , whose favour he had gained by his attitude on the french revolution , wished to create him earl of beaconsfield , but the death of his son deprived the opportunity of such an honour and all its attractions , so the only award he would accept was a pension of £ 2 , 500 . even this modest reward was attacked by the duke of bedford and the earl of lauderdale , to whom burke replied in his letter to a noble lord ( 1796 ) : " it can not at this time be too often repeated ; line upon line ; precept upon precept ; until it comes into the currency of a proverb , to innovate is not to reform " . he argued that he was rewarded on merit , but the duke of bedford received his rewards from inheritance alone , his ancestor being the original pensioner : " mine was from a mild and benevolent sovereign ; his from henry the eighth " . burke also hinted at what would happen to such people if their revolutionary ideas were implemented , and included a description of the british constitution :	0	34

burke 's last publications were the letters on a regicide peace ( october 1796 ) , called forth by negotiations for peace with france by the pitt government . burke regarded this as appeasement , injurious to national dignity and honour . in his second letter , burke wrote of the french revolutionary government : " individuality is left out of their scheme of government . the state is all in all . everything is referred to the production of force ; afterwards , everything is trusted to the use of it . it is military in its principle , in its maxims , in its spirit , and in all its movements . the state has dominion and conquest for its sole objects — dominion over minds by proselytism , over bodies by arms " .	0	28
this is held to be the first explanation of the modern concept of totalitarian state . burke regarded the war with france as ideological , against an " armed doctrine " . he wished that france would not be partitioned due to the effect this would have on the balance of power in europe , and that the war was not against france , but against the revolutionaries governing her . burke said : " it is not france extending a foreign empire over other nations : it is a sect aiming at universal empire , and beginning with the conquest of france " .	71	104

in november 1795 , there was a debate in parliament on the high price of corn and burke wrote a memorandum to pitt on the subject . in december samuel whitbread mp introduced a bill giving magistrates the power to fix minimum wages and fox said he would vote for it . this debate probably led burke to editing his memorandum , as there appeared a notice that burke would soon publish a letter on the subject to the secretary of the board of agriculture , arthur young ; but he failed to complete it . these fragments were inserted into the memorandum after his death and published posthumously in 1800 as , thoughts and details on scarcity . in it , burke expounded " some of the doctrines of political economists bearing upon agriculture as a trade " . burke criticised policies such as maximum prices and state regulation of wages , and set out what the limits of government should be :	96	118

writing to a friend in may 1795 , burke surveyed the causes of discontent : " i think i can hardly overrate the malignity of the principles of protestant ascendency , as they affect ireland ; or of indianism [ i . e . corporate tyranny , as practiced by the british east indies company ] , as they affect these countries , and as they affect asia ; or of jacobinism , as they affect all europe , and the state of human society itself . the last is the greatest evil " . by march 1796 , however burke had changed his mind : " our government and our laws are beset by two different enemies , which are sapping its foundations , indianism , and jacobinism . in some cases they act separately , in some they act in conjunction : but of this i am sure ; that the first is the worst by far , and the hardest to deal with ; and for this amongst other reasons , that it weakens discredits , and ruins that force , which ought to be employed with the greatest credit and energy against the other ; and that it furnishes jacobinism with its strongest arms against all formal government " .	0	86

burke believed that property was essential to human life . because of his conviction that people desire to be ruled and controlled , the division of property formed the basis for social structure , helping develop control within a property - based hierarchy . he viewed the social changes brought on by property as the natural order of events , which should be taking place as the human race progressed . with the division of property and the class system , he also believed that it kept the monarch in check to the needs of the classes beneath the monarch . since property largely aligned or defined divisions of social class , class too , was seen as natural — part of a social agreement that the setting of persons into different classes , is the mutual benefit of all subjects . concern for property is not burke 's only influence . as christopher hitchens summarises , " if modern conservatism can be held to derive from burke , it is not just because he appealed to property owners in behalf of stability but also because he appealed to an everyday interest in the preservation of the ancestral and the immemorial .

in the nineteenth century burke was praised by both liberals and conservatives . burke 's friend philip francis wrote that burke " was a man who truly & prophetically foresaw all the consequences which would rise from the adoption of the french principles " but because burke wrote with so much passion , people were doubtful of his arguments . william windham spoke from the same bench in the house of commons as burke had , when he had separated from fox , and an observer said windham spoke " like the ghost of burke " when he made a speech against peace with france in 1801 . william hazlitt , a political opponent of burke , regarded him as amongst his three favourite writers ( the others being junius and rousseau ) , and made it " a test of the sense and candour of any one belonging to the opposite party , whether he allowed burke to be a great man " . william wordsworth was originally a supporter of the french revolution and attacked burke in ' a letter to the bishop of llandaff ' ( 1793 ) , but by the early nineteenth century he had changed his mind and came to admire burke . in his two addresses to the freeholders of westmorland wordsworth called burke " the most sagacious politician of his age " whose predictions " time has verified " . he later revised his poem the prelude to include praise of burke ( " genius of burke ! forgive the pen seduced / by specious wonders " ) and portrayed him as an old oak . samuel taylor coleridge came to have a similar conversion : he had criticised burke in the watchman , but in his friend ( 1809 – 10 ) coleridge defended burke from charges of inconsistency . later , in his biographia literaria ( 1817 ) coleridge hails burke as a prophet and praises burke for referring " habitually to principles . he was a scientific statesman ; and therefore a seer " . henry brougham wrote of burke : " . . . all his predictions , save one momentary expression , had been more than fulfilled : anarchy and bloodshed had borne sway in france ; conquest and convulsion had desolated europe . . . the providence of mortals is not often able to penetrate so far as this into futurity " . george canning believed that burke 's reflections " has been justified by the course of subsequent events ; and almost every prophecy has been strictly fulfilled " . in 1823 canning wrote that he took burke 's " last works and words [ as ] the manual of my politics " . the conservative prime minister benjamin disraeli " was deeply penetrated with the spirit and sentiment of burke 's later writings " .	60	107

the historian piers brendon asserts that burke laid the moral foundations for the british empire , epitomised in the trial of warren hastings , that was ultimately to be its undoing : when burke stated that " the british empire must be governed on a plan of freedom , for it will be governed by no other " , this was " . . . an ideological bacillus that would prove fatal . this was edmund burke 's paternalistic doctrine that colonial government was a trust . it was to be so exercised for the benefit of subject people that they would eventually attain their birthright — freedom " . as a consequence of this opinion , burke objected to the opium trade , which he called a " smuggling adventure " and condemned " the great disgrace of the british character in india " .	0	72
classification of predators by the extent to which they feed on and interact with their prey is one way ecologists may wish to categorize the different types of predation . instead of focusing on what they eat , this system classifies predators by the way in which they eat , and the general nature of the interaction between predator and prey species . two factors are considered here : how close the predator and prey are ( in the latter two cases the term prey may be replaced with host ) and whether or not the prey are directly murdered by the predator is considered , with true predation and parasitoidism involving certain death .	0	29

grazing organisms may also kill their prey species , but this is seldom the case . while some herbivores like zooplankton live on unicellular phytoplankton and therefore , by the individualized nature of the organism , kill their prey , many only eat a small part of the plant . grazing livestock may pull some grass out at the roots , but most is simply grazed upon , allowing the plant to regrow once again . kelp is frequently grazed in subtidal kelp forests , but regrows at the base of the blade continuously to cope with browsing pressure . animals may also be ' grazed ' upon ; female mosquitos land on hosts briefly to gain sufficient proteins for the development of their offspring . starfish may be grazed on , being capable of regenerating lost arms .	76	99

among predators there is a large degree of specialization . many predators specialize in hunting only one species of prey . others are more opportunistic and will kill and eat almost anything ( examples : humans , leopards , dogs and alligators ) . the specialists are usually particularly well suited to capturing their preferred prey . the prey in turn , are often equally suited to escape that predator . this is called an evolutionary arms race and tends to keep the populations of both species in equilibrium . some predators specialize in certain classes of prey , not just single species . some will switch to other prey ( with varying degrees of success ) when the preferred target is extremely scarce , and they may also resort to scavenging or a herbivorous diet if possible .

predators are often another organism 's prey , and likewise prey are often predators . though blue jays prey on insects , they may in turn be prey for cats and snakes , and snakes may be the prey of hawks . one way of classifying predators is by trophic level . organisms that feed on autotrophs , the producers of the trophic pyramid , are known as herbivores or primary consumers ; those that feed on heterotrophs such as animals are known as secondary consumers . secondary consumers are a type of carnivore , but there are also tertiary consumers eating these carnivores , quartary consumers eating them , and so forth . because only a fraction of energy is passed on to the next level , this hierarchy of predation must end somewhere , and very seldom goes higher than five or six levels , and may go only as high as three trophic levels ( for example , a lion that preys upon large herbivores such as wildebeest , which in turn eat grasses ) . a predator at the top of any food chain ( that is , one that is preyed upon by no organism ) is called an apex predator ; examples include the orca , sperm whale , anaconda , komodo dragon , tiger , lion , tiger shark , nile crocodile , and most eagles and owls — and even omnivorous humans and grizzly bears . an apex predator in one environment may not retain this position as a top predator if introduced to another habitat , such as a dog among alligators , a skunk in the presence of the great horned owl immune to skunk spray , or a snapping turtle among jaguars ; a predatory species introduced into an area where it faces no predators , such as a domestic cat or a dog in some insular environments , can become an apex predator by default .	179	243
many organisms ( of which humans are prime examples ) eat from multiple levels of the food chain and , thus , make this classification problematic . a carnivore may eat both secondary and tertiary consumers , and its prey may itself be difficult to classify for similar reasons . organisms showing both carnivory and herbivory are known as omnivores . even herbivores such as the giant panda may supplement their diet with meat . scavenging of carrion provides a significant part of the diet of some of the most fearsome predators . carnivorous plants would be very difficult to fit into this classification , producing their own food but also digesting anything that they may trap . organisms that eat detritivores or parasites would also be difficult to classify by such a scheme .	50	60
predators may increase the biodiversity of communities by preventing a single species from becoming dominant . such predators are known as keystone species and may have a profound influence on the balance of organisms in a particular ecosystem . introduction or removal of this predator , or changes in its population density , can have drastic cascading effects on the equilibrium of many other populations in the ecosystem . for example , grazers of a grassland may prevent a single dominant species from taking over .	0	15

the elimination of wolves from yellowstone national park had profound impacts on the trophic pyramid . without predation , herbivores began to over - graze many woody browse species , affecting the area 's plant populations . in addition , wolves often kept animals from grazing in riparian areas , which protected beavers from having their food sources encroached upon . the removal of wolves had a direct effect on beaver populations , as their habitat became territory for grazing . furthermore , predation keeps hydrological features such as creeks and streams in normal working order . increased browsing on willows and conifers along blacktail creek due to a lack of predation caused channel incision because they helped slow the water down and hold the soil in place .	37	60
one adaptation helping both predators and prey avoid detection is camouflage , a form of crypsis where species have an appearance that helps them blend into the background . camouflage consists of not only color but also shape and pattern . the background upon which the organism is seen can be both its environment ( e . g . , the praying mantis to the right resembling dead leaves ) or other organisms ( e . g . , zebras ' stripes blend in with each other in a herd , making it difficult for lions to focus on a single target ) . the more convincing camouflage is , the more likely it is that the organism will go unseen .	29	40

while successful predation results in a gain of energy , hunting invariably involves energetic costs as well . when hunger is not an issue , in general most predators will not seek to attack prey since the costs outweigh the benefits . for instance , a large predatory fish like a shark that is well fed in an aquarium will typically ignore the smaller fish swimming around it ( while the prey fish take advantage of the fact that the apex predator is apparently uninterested ) . surplus killing represents a deviation from this type of behaviour . the treatment of consumption in terms of cost - benefit analysis is known as optimal foraging theory , and has been quite successful in the study of animal behavior . in general , costs and benefits are considered in energy gain per unit time , though other factors are also important , such as essential nutrients that have no caloric value but are necessary for survival and health .	128	166
social predation offers the possibility of predators to kill creatures larger than those that members of the species could overpower singly . lions , hyenas , wolves , dholes , african wild dogs , and piranhas can kill large herbivores that single animals of the same species usually do n't dispatch . social predation allows some animals to organize hunts of creatures that would easily escape a single predator ; thus chimpanzees can prey upon colobus monkeys , and harris 's hawks can cut off all possible escapes for a doomed rabbit . extreme specialization of roles is evident in some hunting that requires co - operation between predators of very different species : humans with the aid of falcons or dogs , or fishing with cormorants . social predation is often very complex behavior , and not all social creatures ( for example , domestic cats ) perform it . even without complex intelligence but instinct alone , some ant species can destroy much larger creatures .	0	21
it has been observed that well - fed predator animals in a lax captivity ( for instance , pet or farm animals ) will usually differentiate between putative prey animals who are familiar co - inhabitants in the same human area from wild ones outside the area . this interaction can range from peaceful coexistence to close companionship ; motivation to ignore the predatory instinct may result from mutual advantage or fear of reprisal from human masters who have made clear that harming co - inhabitants will not be tolerated . pet cats and pet mice , for example , may live together in the same human residence without incident as companions . pet cats and pet dogs under human mastership often depend on each other for warmth , companionship , and even protection , particularly in rural areas .	0	47
aposematism , where organisms are brightly colored as a warning to predators , is the antithesis of camouflage . some organisms pose a threat to their predators — for example they may be poisonous , or able to harm them physically . aposematic coloring involves bright , easily recognizable and unique colors and patterns . for example , bright coloration in variable checkerspot butterflies leads to decreased predation attempts by avian predators . upon being harmed ( e . g . , stung ) by their prey , the appearance in such an organism will be remembered as something to avoid . while that particular prey organism may be killed , the coloring benefits the prey species as a whole .	0	18

it is fairly clear that predators tend to lower the survival and fecundity of their prey , but on a higher level of organization , populations of predator and prey species also interact . it is obvious that predators depend on prey for survival , and this is reflected in predator populations being affected by changes in prey populations . it is not so obvious , however , that predators affect prey populations . eating a prey organism may simply make room for another if the prey population is approaching its carrying capacity .	0	33
a lone naked human is at a physical disadvantage to other comparable apex predators in areas such as speed , bone density , weight , and physical strength . humans also lack innate weaponry such as claws . without crafted weapons , society , or cleverness , a lone human can easily be defeated by fit predatory animals , such as wild dogs , big cats and bears ( see man - eater ) . however , humans are not solitary creatures ; they are social animals with highly developed social behaviors . early humans , such as homo erectus , have been using stone tools and weapons for well over a million years . anatomically modern humans have been apex predators since they first evolved , and many species of carnivorous megafauna actively avoid interacting with humans ; the primary environmental competitor for a human is other humans . the one subspecies of carnivorous megafauna that does interact frequently with humans in predatory roles is the domestic dog , but usually as a partner in predation especially if they hunt together . cannibalism has occurred in various places , among various cultures , and for various reasons . at least a few people , such as the donner party , are said to have resorted to it in desperation .	0	28
having small population size is a characteristic almost universally inherent to apex predators , humans and dogs by far the most blatant exceptions . low numbers would n't be a problem for apex predators if there was an abundance of prey and no competition or niche overlap , a scenario that is rarely , if ever , encountered in the wild . the competitive exclusion principle states that if two species ' ecological niches overlap , there is a very high likelihood of competition as both species are in direct competition for the same resources . this factor alone could lead to the extirpation of one or both species , but is compounded by the added factor of prey abundance .	0	23
a predator 's effect on its prey species is hard to see in the short - term . however , if observed over a longer period of time , it is seen that the population of a predator will correlationally rise and fall with the population of its prey in a cycle similar to the boom and bust cycle of economics . if a predator overhunts its prey , the prey population will lower to numbers that are too scarce for the predators to find . this will cause the predator population to dip , decreasing the predation pressure on the prey population . the decrease in predators will allow the small number of prey left to slowly increase their population to somewhere around their previous abundance , which will allow the predator population to increase in response to the greater availability of resources . if a predator hunts its prey species to numbers too low to sustain the population in the short term , they can cause not only the extinction or extirpation of the prey but also the extinction of their own species , a phenomenon known as coextinction . this is a risk that wildlife conservationists encounter when introducing predators to prey that have not coevolved with the same or similar predators . this possibility depends largely on how well and how fast the prey species is able to adapt to the introduced predator . one way that this risk can be avoided is if the predator finds an alternative prey species or if an alternative prey species is introduced ( something that ecologists and environmentalists try to avoid whenever possible ) . an alternative prey species would help to lift some of the predation pressure from the initial prey species , giving the population a chance to recover , however it does not guarantee that the initial prey species will be able to recover as the initial prey population may have been hunted to below sustainable numbers or to complete extinction .	145	191
predators may be put to use in conservation efforts to control introduced species . although the aim in this situation is to remove the introduced species entirely , keeping its abundance down is often the only possibility . predators from its natural range may be introduced to control populations , though in some cases this has little effect , and may even cause unforeseen problems . besides their use in conservation biology , predators are also important for controlling pests in agriculture . natural predators are an environmentally friendly and sustainable way of reducing damage to crops , and are one alternative to the use of chemical agents such as pesticides .	14	37
beer contains ethyl alcohol , the same chemical that is present in wine and distilled spirits and as such , beer consumption has short - term psychological and physiological effects on the user . different concentrations of alcohol in the human body have different effects on a person . the effects of alcohol depend on the amount an individual has drunk , the percentage of alcohol in the beer and the timespan that the consumption took place , the amount of food eaten and whether an individual has taken other prescription , over - the - counter or street drugs , among other factors . drinking enough to cause a blood alcohol concentration ( bac ) of 0 . 03 % - 0 . 12 % typically causes an overall improvement in mood and possible euphoria , increased self - confidence and sociability , decreased anxiety , a flushed , red appearance in the face and impaired judgment and fine muscle coordination . a bac of 0 . 09 % to 0 . 25 % causes lethargy , sedation , balance problems and blurred vision . a bac from 0 . 18 % to 0 . 30 % causes profound confusion , impaired speech ( e . g . , slurred speech ) , staggering , dizziness and vomiting . a bac from 0 . 25 % to 0 . 40 % causes stupor , unconsciousness , anterograde amnesia , vomiting ( death may occur due to inhalation of vomit ( pulmonary aspiration ) while unconscious and respiratory depression ( potentially life - threatening ) . a bac from 0 . 35 % to 0 . 80 % causes a coma ( unconsciousness ) , life - threatening respiratory depression and possibly fatal alcohol poisoning . as with all alcoholic drinks , drinking while driving , operating an aircraft or heavy machinery increases the risk of an accident ; many countries have penalties against drunk driving .	105	162
beer is sold in bottles and cans ; it may also be available on draught , particularly in pubs and bars . the brewing industry is a global business , consisting of several dominant multinational companies and many thousands of smaller producers ranging from brewpubs to regional breweries . the strength of beer is usually around 4 % to 6 % alcohol by volume ( abv ) , although it may vary between 0 . 5 % and 20 % , with some breweries creating examples of 40 % abv and above . beer forms part of the culture of beer - drinking nations and is associated with social traditions such as beer festivals , as well as a rich pub culture involving activities like pub crawling , and pub games such as bar billiards .	93	135
beer is composed mostly of water . regions have water with different mineral components ; as a result , different regions were originally better suited to making certain types of beer , thus giving them a regional character . for example , dublin has hard water well - suited to making stout , such as guinness ; while the plzen region has soft water well - suited to making pilsner ( pale lager ) , such as pilsner urquell . the waters of burton in england contain gypsum , which benefits making pale ale to such a degree that brewers of pale ales will add gypsum to the local water in a process known as burtonisation .	0	6
in 1516 , william iv , duke of bavaria , adopted the reinheitsgebot ( purity law ) , perhaps the oldest food - quality regulation still in use in the 21st century , according to which the only allowed ingredients of beer are water , hops and barley - malt . beer produced before the industrial revolution continued to be made and sold on a domestic scale , although by the 7th century ad , beer was also being produced and sold by european monasteries . during the industrial revolution , the production of beer moved from artisanal manufacture to industrial manufacture , and domestic manufacture ceased to be significant by the end of the 19th century . the development of hydrometers and thermometers changed brewing by allowing the brewer more control of the process and greater knowledge of the results .	0	50
the first step , where the wort is prepared by mixing the starch source ( normally malted barley ) with hot water , is known as " mashing " . hot water ( known as " liquor " in brewing terms ) is mixed with crushed malt or malts ( known as " grist " ) in a mash tun . the mashing process takes around 1 to 2 hours , during which the starches are converted to sugars , and then the sweet wort is drained off the grains . the grains are now washed in a process known as " sparging " . this washing allows the brewer to gather as much of the fermentable liquid from the grains as possible . the process of filtering the spent grain from the wort and sparge water is called wort separation . the traditional process for wort separation is lautering , in which the grain bed itself serves as the filter medium . some modern breweries prefer the use of filter frames which allow a more finely ground grist .	61	90

the first historical mention of the use of hops in beer was from 822 ad in monastery rules written by adalhard the elder , also known as adalard of corbie , though the date normally given for widespread cultivation of hops for use in beer is the thirteenth century . before the thirteenth century , and until the sixteenth century , during which hops took over as the dominant flavouring , beer was flavoured with other plants ; for instance , grains of paradise or alehoof . combinations of various aromatic herbs , berries , and even ingredients like wormwood would be combined into a mixture known as gruit and used as hops are now used . some beers today , such as fraoch ' by the scottish heather ales company and cervoise lancelot by the french brasserie - lancelot company , use plants other than hops for flavouring .	0	49
stout and porter are dark beers made using roasted malts or roast barley , and typically brewed with slow fermenting yeast . there are a number of variations including baltic porter , dry stout , and imperial stout . the name porter was first used in 1721 to describe a dark brown beer popular with the street and river porters of london . this same beer later also became known as stout , though the word stout had been used as early as 1677 . the history and development of stout and porter are intertwined .	0	21
around the world , there are many traditional and ancient starch - based drinks classed as beer . in africa , there are various ethnic beers made from sorghum or millet , such as oshikundu in namibia and tella in ethiopia . kyrgyzstan also has a beer made from millet ; it is a low alcohol , somewhat porridge - like drink called " bozo " . bhutan , nepal , tibet and sikkim also use millet in chhaang , a popular semi - fermented rice / millet drink in the eastern himalayas . further east in china are found huangjiu and choujiu — traditional rice - based beverages related to beer .	18	41
the sweet wort collected from sparging is put into a kettle , or " copper " ( so called because these vessels were traditionally made from copper ) , and boiled , usually for about one hour . during boiling , water in the wort evaporates , but the sugars and other components of the wort remain ; this allows more efficient use of the starch sources in the beer . boiling also destroys any remaining enzymes left over from the mashing stage . hops are added during boiling as a source of bitterness , flavour and aroma . hops may be added at more than one point during the boil . the longer the hops are boiled , the more bitterness they contribute , but the less hop flavour and aroma remains in the beer .	112	136
the starch source in a beer provides the fermentable material and is a key determinant of the strength and flavour of the beer . the most common starch source used in beer is malted grain . grain is malted by soaking it in water , allowing it to begin germination , and then drying the partially germinated grain in a kiln . malting grain produces enzymes that convert starches in the grain into fermentable sugars . different roasting times and temperatures are used to produce different colours of malt from the same grain . darker malts will produce darker beers .	24	35
beer ranges from less than 3 % alcohol by volume ( abv ) to around 14 % abv , though this strength can be increased to around 20 % by re - pitching with champagne yeast , and to 55 % abv by the freeze - distilling process . the alcohol content of beer varies by local practice or beer style . the pale lagers that most consumers are familiar with fall in the range of 4 – 6 % , with a typical abv of 5 % . the customary strength of british ales is quite low , with many session beers being around 4 % abv . some beers , such as table beer are of such low alcohol content ( 1 % – 4 % ) that they are served instead of soft drinks in some schools .	0	48
in many societies , beer is the most popular alcoholic drink . various social traditions and activities are associated with beer drinking , such as playing cards , darts , or other pub games ; attending beer festivals ; engaging in zythology ( the study of beer ) ; visiting a series of pubs in one evening ; visiting breweries ; beer - oriented tourism ; or rating beer . drinking games , such as beer pong , are also popular . a relatively new profession is that of the beer sommelier , who informs restaurant patrons about beers and food pairings .	12	69

beer is the world 's most widely consumed and likely the oldest alcoholic beverage ; it is the third most popular drink overall , after water and tea . the production of beer is called brewing , which involves the fermentation of starches , mainly derived from cereal grains — most commonly malted barley , although wheat , maize ( corn ) , and rice are widely used . most beer is flavoured with hops , which add bitterness and act as a natural preservative , though other flavourings such as herbs or fruit may occasionally be included . the fermentation process causes a natural carbonation effect which is often removed during processing , and replaced with forced carbonation . some of humanity 's earliest known writings refer to the production and distribution of beer : the code of hammurabi included laws regulating beer and beer parlours , and " the hymn to ninkasi " , a prayer to the mesopotamian goddess of beer , served as both a prayer and as a method of remembering the recipe for beer in a culture with few literate people .	29	68

beer was spread through europe by germanic and celtic tribes as far back as 3000 bc , and it was mainly brewed on a domestic scale . the product that the early europeans drank might not be recognised as beer by most people today . alongside the basic starch source , the early european beers might contain fruits , honey , numerous types of plants , spices and other substances such as narcotic herbs . what they did not contain was hops , as that was a later addition , first mentioned in europe around 822 by a carolingian abbot and again in 1067 by abbess hildegard of bingen .	75	109

the word ale comes from old english ealu ( plural ealoþ ) , in turn from proto - germanic * alu ( plural * aluþ ) , ultimately from the proto - indo - european base * h₂elut - , which holds connotations of " sorcery , magic , possession , intoxication " . the word beer comes from old english beor , from proto - germanic * beuza , probably from proto - indo - european * bʰeusom , originally " brewer 's yeast , beer dregs " , although other theories have been provided connecting the word with old english beow , " barley " , or latin bibere , " to drink " . on the currency of two words for the same thing in the germanic languages , the 12th - century old icelandic poem alvissmal says , " ale it is called among men , but among the gods , beer .

the strength of beers has climbed during the later years of the 20th century . vetter 33 , a 10 . 5 % abv ( 33 degrees plato , hence vetter " 33 " ) doppelbock , was listed in the 1994 guinness book of world records as the strongest beer at that time , though samichlaus , by the swiss brewer hurlimann , had also been listed by the guinness book of world records as the strongest at 14 % abv . since then , some brewers have used champagne yeasts to increase the alcohol content of their beers . samuel adams reached 20 % abv with millennium , and then surpassed that amount to 25 . 6 % abv with utopias . the strongest beer brewed in britain was baz 's super brew by parish brewery , a 23 % abv beer . in september 2011 , the scottish brewery brewdog produced ghost deer , which , at 28 % , they claim to be the world 's strongest beer produced by fermentation alone .	15	82

digimon was first conceived as a virtual pet toy in the vein of tamagotchis and , as such , took influence from tamagotchis ' cute and round designs . the small areas of the screens ( 16 by 16 pixels ) meant that character designers had to create monsters whose forms would be easily recognizable . as such , many of the early digimon — including tyrannomon , the first one ever created — were based on dinosaurs . many further designs were created by kenji watanabe , who was brought in to help with the " x - antibody " creatures and art for the digimon collectible card game . watanabe was one influenced by american comics , which were beginning to gain popularity in japan , and as such began to make his characters look stronger and " cool . " the character creation process , however , has for most of the franchise 's history been collaborative and reliant on conversation and brainstorming .	111	166

the first digimon anime introduced the digimon life cycle : they age in a similar fashion to real organisms , but do not die under normal circumstances because they are made of reconfigurable data , which can be seen throughout the show . any digimon that receives a fatal wound will dissolve into infinitesimal bits of data . the data then recomposes itself as a digi - egg , which will hatch when rubbed gently , and the digimon goes through its life cycle again . digimon who are reincarnated in this way will sometimes retain some or all their memories of their previous life . however , if a digimon 's data is completely destroyed , they will die .	43	57

the european publishing company , panini , approached digimon in different ways in different countries . while germany created their own adaptations of episodes , the united kingdom ( uk ) reprinted the dark horse titles , then translated some of the german adaptations of adventure 02 episodes . eventually the uk comics were given their own original stories , which appeared in both the uk 's official digimon magazine and the official uk fox kids companion magazine , wickid . these original stories only roughly followed the continuity of adventure 02 . when the comic switched to the tamers series the storylines adhered to continuity more strictly ; sometimes it would expand on subject matter not covered by the original japanese anime ( such as mitsuo yamaki 's past ) or the english adaptations of the television shows and movies ( such as ryo 's story or the movies that remained undubbed until 2005 ) . in a money saving venture , the original stories were later removed from digimon magazine , which returned to printing translated german adaptations of tamers episodes . eventually , both magazines were cancelled .	49	80

isps provide internet access , employing a range of technologies to connect users to their network . available technologies have ranged from computer modems with acoustic couplers to telephone lines , to television cable ( catv ) , wireless ethernet ( wi - fi ) , and fiber optics .	17	49
for users and small businesses , traditional options include copper wires to provide dial - up , dsl , typically asymmetric digital subscriber line ( adsl ) , cable modem or integrated services digital network ( isdn ) ( typically basic rate interface ) . using fiber - optics to end users is called fiber to the home or similar names .	45	61

in the simplest case , a single connection is established to an upstream isp and is used to transmit data to or from areas of the internet beyond the home network ; this mode of interconnection is often cascaded multiple times until reaching a tier 1 carrier . in reality , the situation is often more complex . isps with more than one point of presence ( pop ) may have separate connections to an upstream isp at multiple pops , or they may be customers of multiple upstream isps and may have connections to each one of them at one or more point of presence . transit isps provide large amounts of bandwidth for connecting hosting isps and access isps .	107	121
internet service providers in many countries are legally required ( e . g . , via communications assistance for law enforcement act ( calea ) in the u . s . ) to allow law enforcement agencies to monitor some or all of the information transmitted by the isp . furthermore , in some countries isps are subject to monitoring by intelligence agencies . in the u . s . , a controversial national security agency program known as prism provides for broad monitoring of internet users traffic and has raised concerns about potential violation of the privacy protections in the fourth amendment to the united states constitution . modern isps integrate a wide array of surveillance and packet sniffing equipment into their networks , which then feeds the data to law - enforcement / intelligence networks ( such as dcsnet in the united states , or sorm in russia ) allowing monitoring of internet traffic in real time .	109	159

the first use of asphalt / bitumen in the new world was by indigenous peoples . on the west coast , as early as the 13th century , the tongva , luiseno and chumash peoples collected the naturally occurring asphalt / bitumen that seeped to the surface above underlying petroleum deposits . all three used the substance as an adhesive . it is found on many different artifacts of tools and ceremonial items . for example , it was used on rattles to adhere gourds or turtle shells to rattle handles . it was also used in decorations . small round shell beads were often set in asphaltum to provide decorations . it was used as a sealant on baskets to make them watertight for carrying water . asphaltum was used also to seal the planks on ocean - going canoes .	0	15
in alberta , five bitumen upgraders produce synthetic crude oil and a variety of other products : the suncor energy upgrader near fort mcmurray , alberta produces synthetic crude oil plus diesel fuel ; the syncrude canada , canadian natural resources , and nexen upgraders near fort mcmurray produce synthetic crude oil ; and the shell scotford upgrader near edmonton produces synthetic crude oil plus an intermediate feedstock for the nearby shell oil refinery . a sixth upgrader , under construction in 2015 near redwater , alberta , will upgrade half of its crude bitumen directly to diesel fuel , with the remainder of the output being sold as feedstock to nearby oil refineries and petrochemical plants .	0	74
asphalt / bitumen is typically stored and transported at temperatures around 150 ° c ( 302 ° f ) . sometimes diesel oil or kerosene are mixed in before shipping to retain liquidity ; upon delivery , these lighter materials are separated out of the mixture . this mixture is often called " bitumen feedstock " , or bfs . some dump trucks route the hot engine exhaust through pipes in the dump body to keep the material warm . the backs of tippers carrying asphalt / bitumen , as well as some handling equipment , are also commonly sprayed with a releasing agent before filling to aid release . diesel oil is no longer used as a release agent due to environmental concerns .	110	124
the albanian bitumen extraction has a long history and was practiced in an organized way by the romans . after centuries of silence , the first mentions of albanian bitumen appeared only in 1868 , when the frenchman coquand published the first geological description of the deposits of albanian bitumen . in 1875 , the exploitation rights were granted to the ottoman government and in 1912 , they were transferred to the italian company simsa . since 1945 , the mine was exploited by the albanian government and from 2001 to date , the management passed to a french company , which organized the mining process for the manufacture of the natural bitumen on an industrial scale .	19	50

the word asphalt is derived from the late middle english , in turn from french asphalte , based on late latin asphalton , asphaltum , which is the latinisation of the greek ασφαλτος ( asphaltos , asphalton ) , a word meaning " asphalt / bitumen / pitch " , which perhaps derives from α - , " without " and σφαλλω ( sfallo ) , " make fall " . note that in french , the term asphalte is used for naturally occurring bitumen - soaked limestone deposits , and for specialised manufactured products with fewer voids or greater bitumen content than the " asphaltic concrete " used to pave roads . it is a significant fact that the first use of asphalt by the ancients was in the nature of a cement for securing or joining together various objects , and it thus seems likely that the name itself was expressive of this application . specifically herodotus mentioned that bitumen was brought to babylon to build its gigantic fortification wall . from the greek , the word passed into late latin , and thence into french ( asphalte ) and english ( " asphaltum " and " asphalt " ) .	0	70
the terms asphalt and bitumen are often used interchangeably to mean both natural and manufactured forms of the substance . in american english , asphalt ( or asphalt cement ) is the carefully refined residue from the distillation process of selected crude oils . outside the united states , the product is often called bitumen . geologists often prefer the term bitumen . common usage often refers to various forms of asphalt / bitumen as " tar " , such as at the la brea tar pits . another archaic term for asphalt / bitumen is " pitch " .	44	55

the world 's largest deposit of natural bitumen , known as the athabasca oil sands is located in the mcmurray formation of northern alberta . this formation is from the early cretaceous , and is composed of numerous lenses of oil - bearing sand with up to 20 % oil . isotopic studies attribute the oil deposits to be about 110 million years old . two smaller but still very large formations occur in the peace river oil sands and the cold lake oil sands , to the west and southeast of the athabasca oil sands , respectively . of the alberta bitumen deposits , only parts of the athabasca oil sands are shallow enough to be suitable for surface mining . the other 80 % has to be produced by oil wells using enhanced oil recovery techniques like steam - assisted gravity drainage .	0	24
the first british patent for the use of asphalt / bitumen was ' cassell 's patent asphalte or bitumen ' in 1834 . then on 25 november 1837 , richard tappin claridge patented the use of seyssel asphalt ( patent # 7849 ) , for use in asphalte pavement , having seen it employed in france and belgium when visiting with frederick walter simms , who worked with him on the introduction of asphalt to britain . dr t . lamb phipson writes that his father , samuel ryland phipson , a friend of claridge , was also " instrumental in introducing the asphalte pavement ( in 1836 ) " . indeed , mastic pavements had been previously employed at vauxhall by a competitor of claridge , but without success .	23	76

the value of the deposit was obvious from the start , but the means of extracting the bitumen were not . the nearest town , fort mcmurray , alberta was a small fur trading post , other markets were far away , and transportation costs were too high to ship the raw bituminous sand for paving . in 1915 , sidney ells of the federal mines branch experimented with separation techniques and used the bitumen to pave 600 feet of road in edmonton , alberta . other roads in alberta were paved with oil sands , but it was generally not economic . during the 1920s dr . karl a . clark of the alberta research council patented a hot water oil separation process and entrepreneur robert c . fitzsimmons built the bitumount oil separation plant , which between 1925 and 1958 produced up to 300 barrels ( 50 m3 ) per day of bitumen using dr . clark 's method . most of the bitumen was used for waterproofing roofs , but other uses included fuels , lubrication oils , printers ink , medicines , rust and acid - proof paints , fireproof roofing , street paving , patent leather , and fence post preservatives . eventually fitzsimmons ran out of money and the plant was taken over by the alberta government . today the bitumount plant is a provincial historic site .	57	85
naturally occurring crude asphalt / bitumen impregnated in sedimentary rock is the prime feed stock for petroleum production from " oil sands " , currently under development in alberta , canada . canada has most of the world 's supply of natural asphalt / bitumen , covering 140 , 000 square kilometres ( an area larger than england ) , giving it the second - largest proven oil reserves in the world . the athabasca oil sands is the largest asphalt / bitumen deposit in canada and the only one accessible to surface mining , although recent technological breakthroughs have resulted in deeper deposits becoming producible by in situ methods . because of oil price increases after 2003 , producing bitumen became highly profitable , but as a result of the decline after 2014 it became uneconomic to build new plants again . by 2014 , canadian crude asphalt / bitumen production averaged about 2 . 3 million barrels ( 370 , 000 m3 ) per day and was projected to rise to 4 . 4 million barrels ( 700 , 000 m3 ) per day by 2020 . the total amount of crude asphalt / bitumen in alberta which could be extracted is estimated to be about 310 billion barrels ( 50×10 ^ 9 m3 ) , which at a rate of 4 , 400 , 000 barrels per day ( 700 , 000 m3 / d ) would last about 200 years .	32	72
roofing shingles account for most of the remaining asphalt / bitumen consumption . other uses include cattle sprays , fence - post treatments , and waterproofing for fabrics . asphalt / bitumen is used to make japan black , a lacquer known especially for its use on iron and steel , and it is also used in paint and marker inks by some graffiti supply companies to increase the weather resistance and permanence of the paint or ink , and to make the color much darker .

the expression " bitumen " originated in the sanskrit , where we find the words jatu , meaning " pitch , " and jatu - krit , meaning " pitch creating " , " pitch producing " ( referring to coniferous or resinous trees ) . the latin equivalent is claimed by some to be originally gwitu - men ( pertaining to pitch ) , and by others , pixtumens ( exuding or bubbling pitch ) , which was subsequently shortened to bitumen , thence passing via french into english . from the same root is derived the anglo saxon word cwidu ( mastix ) , the german word kitt ( cement or mastic ) and the old norse word kvada .	91	121

asphalt / bitumen can sometimes be confused with " coal tar " , which is a visually similar black , thermoplastic material produced by the destructive distillation of coal . during the early and mid - 20th century when town gas was produced , coal tar was a readily available byproduct and extensively used as the binder for road aggregates . the addition of tar to macadam roads led to the word tarmac , which is now used in common parlance to refer to road - making materials . however , since the 1970s , when natural gas succeeded town gas , asphalt / bitumen has completely overtaken the use of coal tar in these applications . other examples of this confusion include the la brea tar pits and the canadian oil sands , both of which actually contain natural bitumen rather than tar . pitch is another term sometimes used at times to refer to asphalt / bitumen , as in pitch lake .	0	29
one hundred years after the fall of constantinople in 1453 , pierre belon described in his work observations in 1553 that pissasphalto , a mixture of pitch and bitumen , was used in dubrovnik for tarring of ships from where it was exported to a market place in venice where it could be bought by anyone . an 1838 edition of mechanics magazine cites an early use of asphalt in france . a pamphlet dated 1621 , by " a certain monsieur d'eyrinys , states that he had discovered the existence ( of asphaltum ) in large quantities in the vicinity of neufchatel " , and that he proposed to use it in a variety of ways – " principally in the construction of air - proof granaries , and in protecting , by means of the arches , the water - courses in the city of paris from the intrusion of dirt and filth " , which at that time made the water unusable . " he expatiates also on the excellence of this material for forming level and durable terraces " in palaces , " the notion of forming such terraces in the streets not one likely to cross the brain of a parisian of that generation " . but it was generally neglected in france until the revolution of 1830 . then , in the 1830s , there was a surge of interest , and asphalt became widely used " for pavements , flat roofs , and the lining of cisterns , and in england , some use of it had been made of it for similar purposes " . its rise in europe was " a sudden phenomenon " , after natural deposits were found " in france at osbann ( basrhin ) , the parc ( l'ain ) and the puy - de - la - poix ( puy - de - dome ) " , although it could also be made artificially . one of the earliest uses in france was the laying of about 24 , 000 square yards of seyssel asphalt at the place de la concorde in 1835 .	57	71
canada has the world 's largest deposit of natural bitumen in the athabasca oil sands and canadian first nations along the athabasca river had long used it to waterproof their canoes . in 1719 , a cree indian named wa - pa - su brought a sample for trade to henry kelsey of the hudson ’ s bay company , who was the first recorded european to see it . however , it was n't until 1787 that fur trader and explorer alexander mackenzie saw the athabasca oil sands and said , " at about 24 miles from the fork ( of the athabasca and clearwater rivers ) are some bituminous fountains into which a pole of 20 feet long may be inserted without the least resistance .

mastic asphalt is a type of asphalt which differs from dense graded asphalt ( asphalt concrete ) in that it has a higher asphalt / bitumen ( binder ) content , usually around 7 – 10 % of the whole aggregate mix , as opposed to rolled asphalt concrete , which has only around 5 % added asphalt / bitumen . this thermoplastic substance is widely used in the building industry for waterproofing flat roofs and tanking underground . mastic asphalt is heated to a temperature of 210 ° c ( 410 ° f ) and is spread in layers to form an impervious barrier about 20 millimeters ( 0 . 79 inches ) thick .	0	60
selenizza is mainly used as an additive in the road construction sector . it is mixed with traditional bitumen to improve both the viscoelastic properties and the resistance to ageing . it may be blended with the hot bitumen in tanks , but its granular form allows it to be fed in the mixer or in the recycling ring of normal asphalt plants . other typical applications include the production of mastic asphalts for sidewalks , bridges , car - parks and urban roads as well as drilling fluid additives for the oil and gas industry . selenizza is available in powder or in granular material of various particle sizes and is packaged in big bags or in thermal fusible polyethylene bags .	0	12
in british english , the word ' asphalt ' is used to refer to a mixture of mineral aggregate and asphalt / bitumen ( also called tarmac in common parlance ) . when bitumen is mixed with clay it is usually called asphaltum . the earlier word ' asphaltum ' is now archaic and not commonly used . [ citation needed ] in american english , ' asphalt ' is equivalent to the british ' bitumen ' . however , ' asphalt ' is also commonly used as a shortened form of ' asphalt concrete ' ( therefore equivalent to the british ' asphalt ' or ' tarmac ' ) . in australian english , bitumen is often used as the generic term for road surfaces . in canadian english , the word bitumen is used to refer to the vast canadian deposits of extremely heavy crude oil , while asphalt is used for the oil refinery product used to pave roads and manufacture roof shingles and various waterproofing products . diluted bitumen ( diluted with naphtha to make it flow in pipelines ) is known as dilbit in the canadian petroleum industry , while bitumen " upgraded " to synthetic crude oil is known as syncrude and syncrude blended with bitumen as synbit . bitumen is still the preferred geological term for naturally occurring deposits of the solid or semi - solid form of petroleum . bituminous rock is a form of sandstone impregnated with bitumen . the tar sands of alberta , canada are a similar material .	215	236
bitumen was the nemesis of many artists during the 19th century . although widely used for a time , it ultimately proved unstable for use in oil painting , especially when mixed with the most common diluents , such as linseed oil , varnish and turpentine . unless thoroughly diluted , bitumen never fully solidifies and will in time corrupt the other pigments with which it comes into contact . the use of bitumen as a glaze to set in shadow or mixed with other colors to render a darker tone resulted in the eventual deterioration of many paintings , for instance those of delacroix . perhaps the most famous example of the destructiveness of bitumen is theodore gericault 's raft of the medusa ( 1818 – 1819 ) , where his use of bitumen caused the brilliant colors to degenerate into dark greens and blacks and the paint and canvas to buckle .	0	11
in 1914 , claridge 's company entered into a joint venture to produce tar - bound macadam , with materials manufactured through a subsidiary company called clarmac roads ltd . two products resulted , namely clarmac , and clarphalte , with the former being manufactured by clarmac roads and the latter by claridge 's patent asphalte co . , although clarmac was more widely used . [ note 1 ] however , the first world war impacted financially on the clarmac company , which entered into liquidation in 1915 . the failure of clarmac roads ltd had a flow - on effect to claridge 's company , which was itself compulsorily wound up , ceasing operations in 1917 , having invested a substantial amount of funds into the new venture , both at the outset , and in a subsequent attempt to save the clarmac company .	70	89
the largest use of asphalt / bitumen is for making asphalt concrete for road surfaces and accounts for approximately 85 % of the asphalt consumed in the united states . asphalt concrete pavement mixes are typically composed of 5 % asphalt / bitumen cement and 95 % aggregates ( stone , sand , and gravel ) . due to its highly viscous nature , asphalt / bitumen cement must be heated so it can be mixed with the aggregates at the asphalt mixing facility . the temperature required varies depending upon characteristics of the asphalt / bitumen and the aggregates , but warm - mix asphalt technologies allow producers to reduce the temperature required . there are about 4 , 000 asphalt concrete mixing plants in the u . s . , and a similar number in europe .	0	29
about 40 , 000 , 000 tons were produced in 1984 [ needs update ] . it is obtained as the " heavy " ( i . e . , difficult to distill ) fraction . material with a boiling point greater than around 500 ° c is considered asphalt . vacuum distillation separates it from the other components in crude oil ( such as naphtha , gasoline and diesel ) . the resulting material is typically further treated to extract small but valuable amounts of lubricants and to adjust the properties of the material to suit applications . in a de - asphalting unit , the crude asphalt is treated with either propane or butane in a supercritical phase to extract the lighter molecules , which are then separated . further processing is possible by " blowing " the product : namely reacting it with oxygen . this step makes the product harder and more viscous .	36	50
selenizza is a naturally occurring solid hydrocarbon bitumen found in the native asphalt deposit of selenice , in albania , the only european asphalt mine still in use . the rock asphalt is found in the form of veins , filling cracks in a more or less horizontal direction . the bitumen content varies from 83 % to 92 % ( soluble in carbon disulphide ) , with a penetration value near to zero and a softening point ( ring & ball ) around 120 ° c . the insoluble matter , consisting mainly of silica ore , ranges from 8 % to 17 % .	29	49

denial of service attacks are designed to make a machine or network resource unavailable to its intended users . attackers can deny service to individual victims , such as by deliberately entering a wrong password enough consecutive times to cause the victim account to be locked , or they may overload the capabilities of a machine or network and block all users at once . while a network attack from a single ip address can be blocked by adding a new firewall rule , many forms of distributed denial of service ( ddos ) attacks are possible , where the attack comes from a large number of points – and defending is much more difficult . such attacks can originate from the zombie computers of a botnet , but a range of other techniques are possible including reflection and amplification attacks , where innocent systems are fooled into sending traffic to the victim .	65	115
if access is gained to a car 's internal controller area network , it is possible to disable the brakes and turn the steering wheel . computerized engine timing , cruise control , anti - lock brakes , seat belt tensioners , door locks , airbags and advanced driver assistance systems make these disruptions possible , and self - driving cars go even further . connected cars may use wifi and bluetooth to communicate with onboard consumer devices , and the cell phone network to contact concierge and emergency assistance services or get navigational or entertainment information ; each of these networks is a potential entry point for malware or an attacker . researchers in 2011 were even able to use a malicious compact disc in a car 's stereo system as a successful attack vector , and cars with built - in voice recognition or remote assistance features have onboard microphones which could be used for eavesdropping .	113	158

within computer systems , two of many security models capable of enforcing privilege separation are access control lists ( acls ) and capability - based security . using acls to confine programs has been proven to be insecure in many situations , such as if the host computer can be tricked into indirectly allowing restricted file access , an issue known as the confused deputy problem . it has also been shown that the promise of acls of giving access to an object to only one person can never be guaranteed in practice . both of these problems are resolved by capabilities . this does not mean practical flaws exist in all acl - based systems , but only that the designers of certain utilities must take responsibility to ensure that they do not introduce flaws .

in 1994 , over a hundred intrusions were made by unidentified crackers into the rome laboratory , the us air force 's main command and research facility . using trojan horses , hackers were able to obtain unrestricted access to rome 's networking systems and remove traces of their activities . the intruders were able to obtain classified files , such as air tasking order systems data and furthermore able to penetrate connected networks of national aeronautics and space administration 's goddard space flight center , wright - patterson air force base , some defense contractors , and other private sector organizations , by posing as a trusted rome center user .	0	27
in july of 2015 , a hacker group known as " the impact team " successfully breached the extramarital relationship website ashley madison . the group claimed that they had taken not only company data but user data as well . after the breach , the impact team dumped emails from the company 's ceo , to prove their point , and threatened to dump customer data unless the website was taken down permanently . with this initial data release , the group stated “ avid life media has been instructed to take ashley madison and established men offline permanently in all forms , or we will release all customer records , including profiles with all the customers ' secret sexual fantasies and matching credit card transactions , real names and addresses , and employee documents and emails . the other websites may stay online . ” when avid life media , the parent company that created the ashley madison website , did not take the site offline , the impact group released two more compressed files , one 9 . 7 gb and the second 20 gb . after the second data dump , avid life media ceo noel biderman resigned , but the website remained functional .	0	23

the question of whether the government should intervene or not in the regulation of the cyberspace is a very polemical one . indeed , for as long as it has existed and by definition , the cyberspace is a virtual space free of any government intervention . where everyone agree that an improvement on cybersecurity is more than vital , is the government the best actor to solve this issue ? many government officials and experts think that the government should step in and that there is a crucial need for regulation , mainly due to the failure of the private sector to solve efficiently the cybersecurity problem . r . clarke said during a panel discussion at the rsa security conference in san francisco , he believes that the " industry only responds when you threaten regulation . if industry does n't respond ( to the threat ) , you have to follow through . " on the other hand , executives from the private sector agree that improvements are necessary , but think that the government intervention would affect their ability to innovate efficiently .	109	138

on october 3 , 2010 , public safety canada unveiled canada ’ s cyber security strategy , following a speech from the throne commitment to boost the security of canadian cyberspace . the aim of the strategy is to strengthen canada ’ s " cyber systems and critical infrastructure sectors , support economic growth and protect canadians as they connect to each other and to the world . " three main pillars define the strategy : securing government systems , partnering to secure vital cyber systems outside the federal government , and helping canadians to be secure online . the strategy involves multiple departments and agencies across the government of canada . the cyber incident management framework for canada outlines these responsibilities , and provides a plan for coordinated response between government and other partners in the event of a cyber incident . the action plan 2010 – 2015 for canada 's cyber security strategy outlines the ongoing implementation of the strategy .	0	31
computers control functions at many utilities , including coordination of telecommunications , the power grid , nuclear power plants , and valve opening and closing in water and gas networks . the internet is a potential attack vector for such machines if connected , but the stuxnet worm demonstrated that even equipment controlled by computers not connected to the internet can be vulnerable to physical damage caused by malicious commands sent to industrial equipment ( in that case uranium enrichment centrifuges ) which are infected via removable media . in 2014 , the computer emergency readiness team , a division of the department of homeland security , investigated 79 hacking incidents at energy companies .	89	114
today , computer security comprises mainly " preventive " measures , like firewalls or an exit procedure . a firewall can be defined as a way of filtering network data between a host or a network and another network , such as the internet , and can be implemented as software running on the machine , hooking into the network stack ( or , in the case of most unix - based operating systems such as linux , built into the operating system kernel ) to provide real time filtering and blocking . another implementation is a so - called physical firewall which consists of a separate machine filtering network traffic . firewalls are common amongst machines that are permanently connected to the internet .	0	17
serious financial damage has been caused by security breaches , but because there is no standard model for estimating the cost of an incident , the only data available is that which is made public by the organizations involved . " several computer security consulting firms produce estimates of total worldwide losses attributable to virus and worm attacks and to hostile digital acts in general . the 2003 loss estimates by these firms range from $ 13 billion ( worms and viruses only ) to $ 226 billion ( for all forms of covert attacks ) . the reliability of these estimates is often challenged ; the underlying methodology is basically anecdotal .

while hardware may be a source of insecurity , such as with microchip vulnerabilities maliciously introduced during the manufacturing process , hardware - based or assisted computer security also offers an alternative to software - only computer security . using devices and methods such as dongles , trusted platform modules , intrusion - aware cases , drive locks , disabling usb ports , and mobile - enabled access may be considered more secure due to the physical access ( or sophisticated backdoor access ) required in order to be compromised . each of these is covered in more detail below .	0	38

public safety canada ’ s canadian cyber incident response centre ( ccirc ) is responsible for mitigating and responding to threats to canada ’ s critical infrastructure and cyber systems . the ccirc provides support to mitigate cyber threats , technical support to respond and recover from targeted cyber attacks , and provides online tools for members of canada ’ s critical infrastructure sectors . the ccirc posts regular cyber security bulletins on the public safety canada website . the ccirc also operates an online reporting tool where individuals and organizations can report a cyber incident . canada 's cyber security strategy is part of a larger , integrated approach to critical infrastructure protection , and functions as a counterpart document to the national strategy and action plan for critical infrastructure .	0	30
this has led to new terms such as cyberwarfare and cyberterrorism . more and more critical infrastructure is being controlled via computer programs that , while increasing efficiency , exposes new vulnerabilities . the test will be to see if governments and corporations that control critical systems such as energy , communications and other information will be able to prevent attacks before they occur . as jay cross , the chief scientist of the internet time group , remarked , " connectedness begets vulnerability .

samkhya school espouses dualism between consciousness and matter . it regards the universe as consisting of two realities ; purusa ( consciousness ) and prakriti ( matter ) . jiva ( a living being ) is that state in which purusa is bonded to prakriti in some form . this fusion , state the samkhya scholars , led to the emergence of buddhi ( awareness , intellect ) and ahankara ( individualized ego consciousness , “ i - maker ” ) . the universe is described by this school as one created by purusa - prakriti entities infused with various permutations and combinations of variously enumerated elements , senses , feelings , activity and mind .	0	8
samkhya philosophy includes a theory of gunas ( qualities , innate tendencies , psyche ) . guna , it states , are of three types : sattva being good , compassionate , illuminating , positive , and constructive ; rajas guna is one of activity , chaotic , passion , impulsive , potentially good or bad ; and tamas being the quality of darkness , ignorance , destructive , lethargic , negative . everything , all life forms and human beings , state samkhya scholars , have these three gunas , but in different proportions . the interplay of these gunas defines the character of someone or something , of nature and determines the progress of life . samkhya theorises a pluralism of souls ( jeevatmas ) who possess consciousness , but denies the existence of ishvara ( god ) . classical samkhya is considered an atheist / non - theistic hindu philosophy .	16	72

in indian philosophy , yoga is among other things , the name of one of the six astika philosophical schools . the yoga philosophical system is closely allied with the dualism premises of samkhya school . the yoga school accepts the samkhya psychology and metaphysics , but is considered theistic because it accepts the concept of " personal god " , unlike samkhya . the epistemology of the yoga school , like the samkhya school , relies on three of six pramanas as the means of gaining reliable knowledge : pratyaksa ( perception ) , anumana ( inference ) and sabda ( aptavacana , word / testimony of reliable sources ) .	36	63

the yoga school builds on the samkhya school theory that jnana ( knowledge ) is a sufficient means to moksha . it suggests that systematic techniques / practice ( personal experimentation ) combined with samkhya 's approach to knowledge is the path to moksha . yoga shares several central ideas with advaita vedanta , with the difference that yoga is a form of experimental mysticism while advaita vedanta is a form of monistic personalism . like advaita vedanta , the yoga school of hindu philosophy states that liberation / freedom in this life is achievable , and this occurs when an individual fully understands and realizes the equivalence of atman ( soul , self ) and brahman .	0	20

vaisesika metaphysical premises are founded on a form of atomism , that the reality is composed of four substances ( earth , water , air , fire ) . each of these four are of two types : atomic ( paramanu ) and composite . an atom is , according to vaisesika scholars , that which is indestructible ( anitya ) , indivisible , and has a special kind of dimension , called “ small ” ( anu ) . a composite , in this philosophy , is defined to be anything which is divisible into atoms . whatever human beings perceive is composite , while atoms are invisible . the vaisesikas stated that size , form , truths and everything that human beings experience as a whole is a function of atoms , their number and their spatial arrangements , their guna ( quality ) , karma ( activity ) , samanya ( commonness ) , visesa ( particularity ) and amavaya ( inherence , inseparable connectedness of everything ) .	0	28
in its metaphysics , nyaya school is closer to the vaisesika school than others . it holds that human suffering results from mistakes / defects produced by activity under wrong knowledge ( notions and ignorance ) . moksha ( liberation ) , it states , is gained through right knowledge . this premise led nyaya to concern itself with epistemology , that is the reliable means to gain correct knowledge and to remove wrong notions . false knowledge is not merely ignorance to naiyayikas , it includes delusion . correct knowledge is discovering and overcoming one 's delusions , and understanding true nature of soul , self and reality . the nyaya sutras begin :	37	50
the mimamsa school has several subschools defined by epistemology . the prabhakara subschool of mimamsa considered five epistemically reliable means to gaining knowledge : pratyaksa ( perception ) , anumana ( inference ) , upamana ( comparison and analogy ) , arthapatti ( postulation , derivation from circumstances ) , and sabda ( word , testimony of past or present reliable experts ) . the kumarila bhatta sub - school of mimamsa added sixth to its canon of reliable epistemology - anupalabdi ( non - perception , negative / cognitive proof ) .	0	9
the metaphysics in mimamsa school consists of both atheistic and theistic doctrines and the school showed little interest in systematic examination of the existence of god . rather , it held that the soul is eternal omnipresent , inherently active spiritual essence , then focussed on the epistemology and metaphysics of dharma . to them , dharma meant rituals and duties , not devas ( gods ) , because devas existed only in name . the mimamsakas held that the vedas are " eternal authorless infallible " , that vedic vidhi ( injunctions ) and mantras in rituals are prescriptive karya ( actions ) , and the rituals are of primary importance and merit . they considered the upanishads and other self - knowledge , spirituality - related texts to be of secondary importance , a philosophical view that the vedanta school disagreed with .	27	52
the vedanta school built upon the teachings of the upanishads and brahma sutras from the first millennium bce and is the most developed and well - known of the hindu schools . the epistemology of the vedantins included , depending on the sub - school , five or six methods as proper and reliable means of gaining any form of knowledge : pratyaksa ( perception ) , anumana ( inference ) , upamana ( comparison and analogy ) , arthapatti ( postulation , derivation from circumstances ) , anupalabdi ( non - perception , negative / cognitive proof ) and sabda ( word , testimony of past or present reliable experts ) . each of these have been further categorized in terms of conditionality , completeness , confidence and possibility of error , by each sub - school of vedanta .	0	31
the emergence of vedanta school represented a period when a more knowledge - centered understanding began to emerge . these focussed on jnana ( knowledge ) driven aspects of the vedic religion and the upanishads . this included metaphysical concepts such as atman and brahman , and emphasized meditation , self - discipline , self - knowledge and abstract spirituality , rather than ritualism . the upanishads were variously interpreted by ancient and medieval era vedanta scholars . consequently , the vedanta separated into many sub - schools , ranging from theistic dualism to non - theistic monism , each interpreting the texts in its own way and producing its own series of sub - commentaries .	19	35
advaita literally means " not two , sole , unity " . it is a sub - school of vedanta , and asserts spiritual and universal non - dualism . its metaphysics is a form of absolute monism , that is all ultimate reality is interconnected oneness . this is the oldest and most widely acknowledged vedantic school . the foundational texts of this school are the brahma sutras and the early upanishads from the 1st millennium bce . its first great consolidator was the 8th century scholar adi shankara , who continued the line of thought of the upanishadic teachers , and that of his teacher 's teacher gaudapada . he wrote extensive commentaries on the major vedantic scriptures and is celebrated as one of the major hindu philosophers from whose doctrines the main currents of modern indian thought are derived .	0	11
ramanuja ( c . 1037 – 1137 ) was the foremost proponent of the philosophy of visistadvaita or qualified non - dualism . visistadvaita advocated the concept of a supreme being with essential qualities or attributes . visistadvaitins argued against the advaitin conception of brahman as an impersonal empty oneness . they saw brahman as an eternal oneness , but also as the source of all creation , which was omnipresent and actively involved in existence . to them the sense of subject - object perception was illusory and a sign of ignorance . however , the individual 's sense of self was not a complete illusion since it was derived from the universal beingness that is brahman . ramanuja saw vishnu as a personification of brahman .	119	127

dvaitadvaita was proposed by nimbarka , a 13th - century vaishnava philosopher from the andhra region . according to this philosophy there are three categories of existence : brahman , soul , and matter . soul and matter are different from brahman in that they have attributes and capacities different from brahman . brahman exists independently , while soul and matter are dependent . thus soul and matter have an existence that is separate yet dependent . further , brahman is a controller , the soul is the enjoyer , and matter the thing enjoyed . also , the highest object of worship is krishna and his consort radha , attended by thousands of gopis ; of the vrindavan ; and devotion consists in self - surrender .	96	127
early history of shaivism is difficult to determine . however , the svetasvatara upanishad ( 400 – 200 bce ) is considered to be the earliest textual exposition of a systematic philosophy of shaivism . shaivism is represented by various philosophical schools , including non - dualist ( abheda ) , dualist ( bheda ) , and non - dualist - with - dualist ( bhedabheda ) perspectives . vidyaranya in his works mentions three major schools of shaiva thought — pashupata shaivism , shaiva siddhanta and pratyabhijna ( kashmir shaivism ) .	9	34

pasupata shaivism ( pasupata , " of pasupati " ) is the oldest of the major shaiva schools . the philosophy of pashupata sect was systematized by lakulish in the 2nd century ce . pasu in pasupati refers to the effect ( or created world ) , the word designates that which is dependent on something ulterior . whereas , pati means the cause ( or principium ) , the word designates the lord , who is the cause of the universe , the pati , or the ruler . pashupatas disapproved of vaishnava theology , known for its doctrine servitude of souls to the supreme being , on the grounds that dependence upon anything could not be the means of cessation of pain and other desired ends . they recognised that those depending upon another and longing for independence will not be emancipated because they still depend upon something other than themselves . according to pasupatas , soul possesses the attributes of the supreme deity when it becomes liberated from the ' germ of every pain ' .	0	18

in monotheism and henotheism , god is conceived of as the supreme being and principal object of faith . the concept of god as described by theologians commonly includes the attributes of omniscience ( infinite knowledge ) , omnipotence ( unlimited power ) , omnipresence ( present everywhere ) , omnibenevolence ( perfect goodness ) , divine simplicity , and eternal and necessary existence . god is also usually defined as a non - corporeal being without any human biological gender , but the concept of god actively ( as opposed to receptively ) creating the universe has caused some religions to give " him " the metaphorical name of " father " . because god is conceived as not being a corporeal being , god cannot ( some say should not ) be portrayed in a literal visual image ; some religious groups use a man ( sometimes old and bearded ) to symbolize god because of his deed of creating man 's mind in the image of his own .	114	171
the earliest written form of the germanic word god ( always , in this usage , capitalized ) comes from the 6th - century christian codex argenteus . the english word itself is derived from the proto - germanic * ǥuđan . the reconstructed proto - indo - european form * ghu - to - m was likely based on the root * ghau ( ə ) - , which meant either " to call " or " to invoke " . the germanic words for god were originally neuter — applying to both genders — but during the process of the christianization of the germanic peoples from their indigenous germanic paganism , the words became a masculine syntactic form .	42	81

in the english language , the capitalized form of god continues to represent a distinction between monotheistic " god " and " gods " in polytheism . the english word god and its counterparts in other languages are normally used for any and all conceptions and , in spite of significant differences between religions , the term remains an english translation common to all . the same holds for hebrew el , but in judaism , god is also given a proper name , the tetragrammaton yhwh , in origin possibly the name of an edomite or midianite deity , yahweh . in many translations of the bible , when the word lord is in all capitals , it signifies that the word represents the tetragrammaton .	65	101
monotheists hold that there is only one god , and may claim that the one true god is worshiped in different religions under different names . the view that all theists actually worship the same god , whether they know it or not , is especially emphasized in hinduism and sikhism . in christianity , the doctrine of the trinity describes god as one god in three persons . the trinity comprises god the father , god the son ( jesus ) , and god the holy spirit . islam 's most fundamental concept is tawhid ( meaning " oneness " or " uniqueness " ) . god is described in the quran as : " say : he is allah , the one and only ; allah , the eternal , absolute ; he begetteth not , nor is he begotten ; and there is none like unto him . " muslims repudiate the christian doctrine of the trinity and divinity of jesus , comparing it to polytheism . in islam , god is beyond all comprehension or equal and does not resemble any of his creations in any way . thus , muslims are not iconodules , and are not expected to visualize god .	152	169
theism generally holds that god exists realistically , objectively , and independently of human thought ; that god created and sustains everything ; that god is omnipotent and eternal ; and that god is personal and interacting with the universe through , for example , religious experience and the prayers of humans . theism holds that god is both transcendent and immanent ; thus , god is simultaneously infinite and in some way present in the affairs of the world . not all theists subscribe to all of these propositions , but each usually subscribes to some of them ( see , by way of comparison , family resemblance ) . catholic theology holds that god is infinitely simple and is not involuntarily subject to time . most theists hold that god is omnipotent , omniscient , and benevolent , although this belief raises questions about god 's responsibility for evil and suffering in the world . some theists ascribe to god a self - conscious or purposeful limiting of omnipotence , omniscience , or benevolence . open theism , by contrast , asserts that , due to the nature of time , god 's omniscience does not mean the deity can predict the future . theism is sometimes used to refer in general to any belief in a god or gods , i . e . , monotheism or polytheism .	0	52
deism holds that god is wholly transcendent : god exists , but does not intervene in the world beyond what was necessary to create it . in this view , god is not anthropomorphic , and neither answers prayers nor produces miracles . common in deism is a belief that god has no interest in humanity and may not even be aware of humanity . pandeism and panendeism , respectively , combine deism with the pantheistic or panentheistic beliefs . pandeism is proposed to explain as to deism why god would create a universe and then abandon it , and as to pantheism , the origin and purpose of the universe .	26	42

pantheism holds that god is the universe and the universe is god , whereas panentheism holds that god contains , but is not identical to , the universe . it is also the view of the liberal catholic church ; theosophy ; some views of hinduism except vaishnavism , which believes in panentheism ; sikhism ; some divisions of neopaganism and taoism , along with many varying denominations and individuals within denominations . kabbalah , jewish mysticism , paints a pantheistic / panentheistic view of god — which has wide acceptance in hasidic judaism , particularly from their founder the baal shem tov — but only as an addition to the jewish view of a personal god , not in the original pantheistic sense that denies or limits persona to god .

another view , advanced by richard dawkins , is that the existence of god is an empirical question , on the grounds that " a universe with a god would be a completely different kind of universe from one without , and it would be a scientific difference . " carl sagan argued that the doctrine of a creator of the universe was difficult to prove or disprove and that the only conceivable scientific discovery that could disprove the existence of a creator would be the discovery that the universe is infinitely old .	50	93

stephen hawking and co - author leonard mlodinow state in their book , the grand design , that it is reasonable to ask who or what created the universe , but if the answer is god , then the question has merely been deflected to that of who created god . both authors claim however , that it is possible to answer these questions purely within the realm of science , and without invoking any divine beings . neuroscientist michael nikoletseas has proposed that questions of the existence of god are no different from questions of natural sciences . following a biological comparative approach , he concludes that it is highly probable that god exists , and , although not visible , it is possible that we know some of his attributes .	0	50

pascal boyer argues that while there is a wide array of supernatural concepts found around the world , in general , supernatural beings tend to behave much like people . the construction of gods and spirits like persons is one of the best known traits of religion . he cites examples from greek mythology , which is , in his opinion , more like a modern soap opera than other religious systems . bertrand du castel and timothy jurgensen demonstrate through formalization that boyer 's explanatory model matches physics ' epistemology in positing not directly observable entities as intermediaries . anthropologist stewart guthrie contends that people project human features onto non - human aspects of the world because it makes those aspects more familiar . sigmund freud also suggested that god concepts are projections of one 's father .	30	47
likewise , emile durkheim was one of the earliest to suggest that gods represent an extension of human social life to include supernatural beings . in line with this reasoning , psychologist matt rossano contends that when humans began living in larger groups , they may have created gods as a means of enforcing morality . in small groups , morality can be enforced by social forces such as gossip or reputation . however , it is much harder to enforce morality using social forces in much larger groups . rossano indicates that by including ever - watchful gods and spirits , humans discovered an effective strategy for restraining selfishness and building more cooperative groups .	0	24
st . anselm 's approach was to define god as , " that than which nothing greater can be conceived " . famed pantheist philosopher baruch spinoza would later carry this idea to its extreme : " by god i understand a being absolutely infinite , i . e . , a substance consisting of infinite attributes , of which each one expresses an eternal and infinite essence . " for spinoza , the whole of the natural universe is made of one substance , god , or its equivalent , nature . his proof for the existence of god was a variation of the ontological argument .	22	69

some findings in the fields of cosmology , evolutionary biology and neuroscience are interpreted by atheists ( including lawrence m . krauss and sam harris ) as evidence that god is an imaginary entity only , with no basis in reality . a single , omniscient god who is imagined to have created the universe and is particularly attentive to the lives of humans has been imagined , embellished and promulgated in a trans - generational manner . richard dawkins interprets various findings not only as a lack of evidence for the material existence of such a god but extensive evidence to the contrary .	0	41
according to the omnipotence paradox or ' paradox of the stone ' , can god create a stone so heavy that he can not lift it ? either he can or he ca n ’ t . if he ca n ’ t , the argument goes , then there is something that he can not do , namely create the stone , and therefore he is not omnipotent . if he can , it continues , then there is also something that he can not do , namely lift the stone , and therefore he is not omnipotent . either way , then , god is not omnipotent . a being that is not omnipotent , though , is not god , according to many theological models . such a god , therefore , does not exist . several answers to this paradox have been proposed .	139	147
different religious traditions assign differing ( though often similar ) attributes and characteristics to god , including expansive powers and abilities , psychological characteristics , gender characteristics , and preferred nomenclature . the assignment of these attributes often differs according to the conceptions of god in the culture from which they arise . for example , attributes of god in christianity , attributes of god in islam , and the thirteen attributes of mercy in judaism share certain similarities arising from their common roots .	0	31

prayer plays a significant role among many believers . muslims believe that the purpose of existence is to worship god . he is viewed as a personal god and there are no intermediaries , such as clergy , to contact god . prayer often also includes supplication and asking forgiveness . god is often believed to be forgiving . for example , a hadith states god would replace a sinless people with one who sinned but still asked repentance . christian theologian alister mcgrath writes that there are good reasons to suggest that a " personal god " is integral to the christian outlook , but that one has to understand it is an analogy . " to say that god is like a person is to affirm the divine ability and willingness to relate to others . this does not imply that god is human , or located at a specific point in the universe . "	9	20
adherents of different religions generally disagree as to how to best worship god and what is god 's plan for mankind , if there is one . there are different approaches to reconciling the contradictory claims of monotheistic religions . one view is taken by exclusivists , who believe they are the chosen people or have exclusive access to absolute truth , generally through revelation or encounter with the divine , which adherents of other religions do not . another view is religious pluralism . a pluralist typically believes that his religion is the right one , but does not deny the partial truth of other religions . an example of a pluralist view in christianity is supersessionism , i . e . , the belief that one 's religion is the fulfillment of previous religions . a third approach is relativistic inclusivism , where everybody is seen as equally right ; an example being universalism : the doctrine that salvation is eventually available for everyone . a fourth approach is syncretism , mixing different elements from different religions . an example of syncretism is the new age movement .	108	136
many medieval philosophers developed arguments for the existence of god , while attempting to comprehend the precise implications of god 's attributes . reconciling some of those attributes generated important philosophical problems and debates . for example , god 's omniscience may seem to imply that god knows how free agents will choose to act . if god does know this , their ostensible free will might be illusory , or foreknowledge does not imply predestination , and if god does not know it , god may not be omniscient .	35	55
the last centuries of philosophy have seen vigorous questions regarding the arguments for god 's existence raised by such philosophers as immanuel kant , david hume and antony flew , although kant held that the argument from morality was valid . the theist response has been either to contend , as does alvin plantinga , that faith is " properly basic " , or to take , as does richard swinburne , the evidentialist position . some theists agree that none of the arguments for god 's existence are compelling , but argue that faith is not a product of reason , but requires risk . there would be no risk , they say , if the arguments for god 's existence were as solid as the laws of logic , a position summed up by pascal as " the heart has reasons of which reason does not know . " a recent theory using concepts from physics and neurophysiology proposes that god can be conceptualized within the theory of integrative level .	0	40
emotions are complex . according to some theories , they are a state of feeling that results in physical and psychological changes that influence our behavior . the physiology of emotion is closely linked to arousal of the nervous system with various states and strengths of arousal relating , apparently , to particular emotions . emotion is also linked to behavioral tendency . extroverted people are more likely to be social and express their emotions , while introverted people are more likely to be more socially withdrawn and conceal their emotions . emotion is often the driving force behind motivation , positive or negative . definition has been described as is a " positive or negative experience that is associated with a particular pattern of physiological activity . " according to other theories , emotions are not causal forces but simply syndromes of components , which might include motivation , feeling , behavior , and physiological changes , but no one of these components is the emotion . nor is the emotion an entity that causes these components	27	54

robert plutchik agreed with ekman 's biologically driven perspective but developed the " wheel of emotions " , suggesting eight primary emotions grouped on a positive or negative basis : joy versus sadness ; anger versus fear ; trust versus disgust ; and surprise versus anticipation . some basic emotions can be modified to form complex emotions . the complex emotions could arise from cultural conditioning or association combined with the basic emotions . alternatively , similar to the way primary colors combine , primary emotions could blend to form the full spectrum of human emotional experience . for example , interpersonal anger and disgust could blend to form contempt . relationships exist between basic emotions , resulting in positive or negative influences .	0	46

perspectives on emotions from evolutionary theory were initiated in the late 19th century with charles darwin 's book the expression of the emotions in man and animals . darwin argued that emotions actually served a purpose for humans , in communication and also in aiding their survival . darwin , therefore , argued that emotions evolved via natural selection and therefore have universal cross - cultural counterparts . darwin also detailed the virtues of experiencing emotions and the parallel experiences that occur in animals . this led the way for animal research on emotions and the eventual determination of the neural underpinnings of emotion .	0	27

an example of this theory in action would be as follows : an emotion - evoking stimulus ( snake ) triggers a pattern of physiological response ( increased heart rate , faster breathing , etc . ) , which is interpreted as a particular emotion ( fear ) . this theory is supported by experiments in which by manipulating the bodily state induces a desired emotional state . some people may believe that emotions give rise to emotion - specific actions : e . g . " i 'm crying because i 'm sad , " or " i ran away because i was scared . " the issue with the james – lange theory is that of causation ( bodily states causing emotions and being a priori ) , not that of the bodily influences on emotional experience ( which can be argued and is still quite prevalent today in biofeedback studies and embodiment theory ) .	12	48

with the two - factor theory now incorporating cognition , several theories began to argue that cognitive activity in the form of judgments , evaluations , or thoughts were entirely necessary for an emotion to occur . one of the main proponents of this view was richard lazarus who argued that emotions must have some cognitive intentionality . the cognitive activity involved in the interpretation of an emotional context may be conscious or unconscious and may or may not take the form of conceptual processing .	58	85

theories dealing with perception either use one or multiples perceptions in order to find an emotion ( goldie , 2007 ) . a recent hybrid of the somatic and cognitive theories of emotion is the perceptual theory . this theory is neo - jamesian in arguing that bodily responses are central to emotions , yet it emphasizes the meaningfulness of emotions or the idea that emotions are about something , as is recognized by cognitive theories . the novel claim of this theory is that conceptually - based cognition is unnecessary for such meaning . rather the bodily changes themselves perceive the meaningful content of the emotion because of being causally triggered by certain situations . in this respect , emotions are held to be analogous to faculties such as vision or touch , which provide information about the relation between the subject and the world in various ways . a sophisticated defense of this view is found in philosopher jesse prinz 's book gut reactions , and psychologist james laird 's book feelings .	150	174

social sciences often examine emotion for the role that it plays in human culture and social interactions . in sociology , emotions are examined for the role they play in human society , social patterns and interactions , and culture . in anthropology , the study of humanity , scholars use ethnography to undertake contextual analyses and cross - cultural comparisons of a range of human activities . some anthropology studies examine the role of emotions in human activities . in the field of communication sciences , critical organizational scholars have examined the role of emotions in organizations , from the perspectives of managers , employees , and even customers . a focus on emotions in organizations can be credited to arlie russell hochschild 's concept of emotional labor . the university of queensland hosts emonet , an e - mail distribution list representing a network of academics that facilitates scholarly discussion of all matters relating to the study of emotion in organizational settings . the list was established in january 1997 and has over 700 members from across the globe .	80	110

a common way in which emotions are conceptualized in sociology is in terms of the multidimensional characteristics including cultural or emotional labels ( e . g . , anger , pride , fear , happiness ) , physiological changes ( e . g . , increased perspiration , changes in pulse rate ) , expressive facial and body movements ( e . g . , smiling , frowning , baring teeth ) , and appraisals of situational cues . one comprehensive theory of emotional arousal in humans has been developed by jonathan turner ( 2007 : 2009 ) . two of the key eliciting factors for the arousal of emotions within this theory are expectations states and sanctions . when people enter a situation or encounter with certain expectations for how the encounter should unfold , they will experience different emotions depending on the extent to which expectations for self , other and situation are met or not met . people can also provide positive or negative sanctions directed at self or other which also trigger different emotional experiences in individuals . turner analyzed a wide range of emotion theories across different fields of research including sociology , psychology , evolutionary science , and neuroscience . based on this analysis , he identified four emotions that all researchers consider being founded on human neurology including assertive - anger , aversion - fear , satisfaction - happiness , and disappointment - sadness . these four categories are called primary emotions and there is some agreement amongst researchers that these primary emotions become combined to produce more elaborate and complex emotional experiences . these more elaborate emotions are called first - order elaborations in turner 's theory and they include sentiments such as pride , triumph , and awe . emotions can also be experienced at different levels of intensity so that feelings of concern are a low - intensity variation of the primary emotion aversion - fear whereas depression is a higher intensity variant .	0	78

in the late 19th century , the most influential theorists were william james ( 1842 – 1910 ) and carl lange ( 1834 – 1900 ) . james was an american psychologist and philosopher who wrote about educational psychology , psychology of religious experience / mysticism , and the philosophy of pragmatism . lange was a danish physician and psychologist . working independently , they developed the james – lange theory , a hypothesis on the origin and nature of emotions . the theory states that within human beings , as a response to experiences in the world , the autonomic nervous system creates physiological events such as muscular tension , a rise in heart rate , perspiration , and dryness of the mouth . emotions , then , are feelings which come about as a result of these physiological changes , rather than being their cause .	0	26

a distinction can be made between emotional episodes and emotional dispositions . emotional dispositions are also comparable to character traits , where someone may be said to be generally disposed to experience certain emotions . for example , an irritable person is generally disposed to feel irritation more easily or quickly than others do . finally , some theorists place emotions within a more general category of " affective states " where affective states can also include emotion - related phenomena such as pleasure and pain , motivational states ( for example , hunger or curiosity ) , moods , dispositions and traits .	12	34

the idea that core affect is but one component of the emotion led to a theory called “ psychological construction . ” according to this theory , an emotional episode consists of a set of components , each of which is an ongoing process and none of which is necessary or sufficient for the emotion to be instantiated . the set of components is not fixed , either by human evolutionary history or by social norms and roles . instead , the emotional episode is assembled at the moment of its occurrence to suit its specific circumstances . one implication is that all cases of , for example , fear are not identical but instead bear a family resemblance to one another .	79	97

walter bradford cannon agreed that physiological responses played a crucial role in emotions , but did not believe that physiological responses alone could explain subjective emotional experiences . he argued that physiological responses were too slow and often imperceptible and this could not account for the relatively rapid and intense subjective awareness of emotion . he also believed that the richness , variety , and temporal course of emotional experiences could not stem from physiological reactions , that reflected fairly undifferentiated fight or flight responses . an example of this theory in action is as follows : an emotion - evoking event ( snake ) triggers simultaneously both a physiological response and a conscious experience of an emotion .	0	27

a situated perspective on emotion , developed by paul e . griffiths and andrea scarantino , emphasizes the importance of external factors in the development and communication of emotion , drawing upon the situationism approach in psychology . this theory is markedly different from both cognitivist and neo - jamesian theories of emotion , both of which see emotion as a purely internal process , with the environment only acting as a stimulus to the emotion . in contrast , a situationist perspective on emotion views emotion as the product of an organism investigating its environment , and observing the responses of other organisms . emotion stimulates the evolution of social relationships , acting as a signal to mediate the behavior of other organisms . in some contexts , the expression of emotion ( both voluntary and involuntary ) could be seen as strategic moves in the transactions between different organisms . the situated perspective on emotion states that conceptual thought is not an inherent part of emotion , since emotion is an action - oriented form of skillful engagement with the world . griffiths and scarantino suggested that this perspective on emotion could be helpful in understanding phobias , as well as the emotions of infants and animals .	0	37

emotions are thought to be related to certain activities in brain areas that direct our attention , motivate our behavior , and determine the significance of what is going on around us . pioneering work by broca ( 1878 ) , papez ( 1937 ) , and maclean ( 1952 ) suggested that emotion is related to a group of structures in the center of the brain called the limbic system , which includes the hypothalamus , cingulate cortex , hippocampi , and other structures . more recent research has shown that some of these limbic structures are not as directly related to emotion as others are while some non - limbic structures have been found to be of greater emotional relevance .	33	85

phillip bard contributed to the theory with his work on animals . bard found that sensory , motor , and physiological information all had to pass through the diencephalon ( particularly the thalamus ) , before being subjected to any further processing . therefore , cannon also argued that it was not anatomically possible for sensory events to trigger a physiological response prior to triggering conscious awareness and emotional stimuli had to trigger both physiological and experiential aspects of emotion simultaneously .	43	81

there are some theories on emotions arguing that cognitive activity in the form of judgments , evaluations , or thoughts are necessary in order for an emotion to occur . a prominent philosophical exponent is robert c . solomon ( for example , the passions , emotions and the meaning of life , 1993 ) . solomon claims that emotions are judgments . he has put forward a more nuanced view which response to what he has called the ‘ standard objection ’ to cognitivism , the idea that a judgment that something is fearsome can occur with or without emotion , so judgment can not be identified with emotion . the theory proposed by nico frijda where appraisal leads to action tendencies is another example .	56	62

emotions can motivate social interactions and relationships and therefore are directly related with basic physiology , particularly with the stress systems . this is important because emotions are related to the anti - stress complex , with an oxytocin - attachment system , which plays a major role in bonding . emotional phenotype temperaments affect social connectedness and fitness in complex social systems ( kurt kortschal 2013 ) . these characteristics are shared with other species and taxa and are due to the effects of genes and their continuous transmission . information that is encoded in the dna sequences provides the blueprint for assembling proteins that make up our cells . zygotes require genetic information from their parental germ cells , and at every speciation event , heritable traits that have enabled its ancestor to survive and reproduce successfully are passed down along with new traits that could be potentially beneficial to the offspring . in the five million years since the linages leading to modern humans and chimpanzees split , only about 1 . 2 % of their genetic material has been modified . this suggests that everything that separates us from chimpanzees must be encoded in that very small amount of dna , including our behaviors . students that study animal behaviors have only identified intraspecific examples of gene - dependent behavioral phenotypes . in voles ( microtus spp . ) minor genetic differences have been identified in a vasopressin receptor gene that corresponds to major species differences in social organization and the mating system ( hammock & young 2005 ) . another potential example with behavioral differences is the focp2 gene , which is involved in neural circuitry handling speech and language ( vargha - khadem et al . 2005 ) . its present form in humans differed from that of the chimpanzees by only a few mutations and has been present for about 200 , 000 years , coinciding with the beginning of modern humans ( enard et al . 2002 ) . speech , language , and social organization are all part of the basis for emotions .	51	68

emotion , in everyday speech , is any relatively brief conscious experience characterized by intense mental activity and a high degree of pleasure or displeasure . scientific discourse has drifted to other meanings and there is no consensus on a definition . emotion is often intertwined with mood , temperament , personality , disposition , and motivation . in some theories , cognition is an important aspect of emotion . those acting primarily on emotion may seem as if they are not thinking , but mental processes are still essential , particularly in the interpretation of events . for example , the realization of danger and subsequent arousal of the nervous system ( e . g . rapid heartbeat and breathing , sweating , muscle tension ) is integral to the experience of fear . other theories , however , claim that emotion is separate from and can precede cognition .	42	57
emotions have been described by some theorists as discrete and consistent responses to internal or external events which have a particular significance for the organism . emotions are brief in duration and consist of a coordinated set of responses , which may include verbal , physiological , behavioural , and neural mechanisms . psychotherapist michael c . graham describes all emotions as existing on a continuum of intensity . thus fear might range from mild concern to terror or shame might range from simple embarrassment to toxic shame . emotions have also been described as biologically given and a result of evolution because they provided good solutions to ancient and recurring problems that faced our ancestors . moods are feelings that tend to be less intense than emotions and that often lack a contextual stimulus .	117	135

for more than 40 years , paul ekman has supported the view that emotions are discrete , measurable , and physiologically distinct . ekman 's most influential work revolved around the finding that certain emotions appeared to be universally recognized , even in cultures that were preliterate and could not have learned associations for facial expressions through media . another classic study found that when participants contorted their facial muscles into distinct facial expressions ( e . g . disgust ) , they reported subjective and physiological experiences that matched the distinct facial expressions . his research findings led him to classify six emotions as basic : anger , disgust , fear , happiness , sadness and surprise .	95	118

western philosophy regarded emotion in varying ways . in stoic theories it was seen as a hindrance to reason and therefore a hindrance to virtue . aristotle believed that emotions were an essential component of virtue . in the aristotelian view all emotions ( called passions ) corresponded to appetites or capacities . during the middle ages , the aristotelian view was adopted and further developed by scholasticism and thomas aquinas in particular . there are also theories of emotions in the works of philosophers such as rene descartes , niccolo machiavelli , baruch spinoza and david hume . in the 19th century emotions were considered adaptive and were studied more frequently from an empiricist psychiatric perspective .	26	36

in his 1884 article william james argued that feelings and emotions were secondary to physiological phenomena . in his theory , james proposed that the perception of what he called an " exciting fact " directly led to a physiological response , known as " emotion . " to account for different types of emotional experiences , james proposed that stimuli trigger activity in the autonomic nervous system , which in turn produces an emotional experience in the brain . the danish psychologist carl lange also proposed a similar theory at around the same time , and therefore this theory became known as the james – lange theory . as james wrote , " the perception of bodily changes , as they occur , is the emotion . " james further claims that " we feel sad because we cry , angry because we strike , afraid because we tremble , and neither we cry , strike , nor tremble because we are sorry , angry , or fearful , as the case may be .

the history of emotions has become an increasingly popular topic recently , with some scholars arguing that it is an essential category of analysis , not unlike class , race , or gender . historians , like other social scientists , assume that emotions , feelings and their expressions are regulated in different ways by both different cultures and different historical times , and constructivist school of history claims even that some sentiments and meta - emotions , for example schadenfreude , are learnt and not only regulated by culture . historians of emotion trace and analyse the changing norms and rules of feeling , while examining emotional regimes , codes , and lexicons from social , cultural or political history perspectives . others focus on the history of medicine , science or psychology . what somebody can and may feel ( and show ) in a given situation , towards certain people or things , depends on social norms and rules . it is thus historically variable and open to change . several research centers have opened in the past few years in germany , england , spain , sweden and australia .	34	90

stanley schachter formulated his theory on the earlier work of a spanish physician , gregorio maranon , who injected patients with epinephrine and subsequently asked them how they felt . interestingly , maranon found that most of these patients felt something but in the absence of an actual emotion - evoking stimulus , the patients were unable to interpret their physiological arousal as an experienced emotion . schachter did agree that physiological reactions played a big role in emotions . he suggested that physiological reactions contributed to emotional experience by facilitating a focused cognitive appraisal of a given physiologically arousing event and that this appraisal was what defined the subjective emotional experience . emotions were thus a result of two - stage process : general physiological arousal , and experience of emotion . for example , the physiological arousal , heart pounding , in a response to an evoking stimulus , the sight of a bear in the kitchen . the brain then quickly scans the area , to explain the pounding , and notices the bear . consequently , the brain interprets the pounding heart as being the result of fearing the bear . with his student , jerome singer , schachter demonstrated that subjects can have different emotional reactions despite being placed into the same physiological state with an injection of epinephrine . subjects were observed to express either anger or amusement depending on whether another person in the situation ( a confederate ) displayed that emotion . hence , the combination of the appraisal of the situation ( cognitive ) and the participants ' reception of adrenaline or a placebo together determined the response . this experiment has been criticized in jesse prinz 's ( 2004 ) gut reactions .	0	29

emotion regulation refers to the cognitive and behavioral strategies people use to influence their own emotional experience . for example , a behavioral strategy in which one avoids a situation to avoid unwanted emotions ( e . g . , trying not to think about the situation , doing distracting activities , etc . ) . depending on the particular school 's general emphasis on either cognitive components of emotion , physical energy discharging , or on symbolic movement and facial expression components of emotion , different schools of psychotherapy approach the regulation of emotion differently . cognitively oriented schools approach them via their cognitive components , such as rational emotive behavior therapy . yet others approach emotions via symbolic movement and facial expression components ( like in contemporary gestalt therapy ) .	97	113

based on discoveries made through neural mapping of the limbic system , the neurobiological explanation of human emotion is that emotion is a pleasant or unpleasant mental state organized in the limbic system of the mammalian brain . if distinguished from reactive responses of reptiles , emotions would then be mammalian elaborations of general vertebrate arousal patterns , in which neurochemicals ( for example , dopamine , noradrenaline , and serotonin ) step - up or step - down the brain 's activity level , as visible in body movements , gestures and postures . emotions can likely be mediated by pheromones ( see fear ) .	38	94

in the 2000s , research in computer science , engineering , psychology and neuroscience has been aimed at developing devices that recognize human affect display and model emotions . in computer science , affective computing is a branch of the study and development of artificial intelligence that deals with the design of systems and devices that can recognize , interpret , and process human emotions . it is an interdisciplinary field spanning computer sciences , psychology , and cognitive science . while the origins of the field may be traced as far back as to early philosophical enquiries into emotion , the more modern branch of computer science originated with rosalind picard 's 1995 paper on affective computing . detecting emotional information begins with passive sensors which capture data about the user 's physical state or behavior without interpreting the input . the data gathered is analogous to the cues humans use to perceive emotions in others . another area within affective computing is the design of computational devices proposed to exhibit either innate emotional capabilities or that are capable of convincingly simulating emotions . emotional speech processing recognizes the user 's emotional state by analyzing speech patterns . the detection and processing of facial expression or body gestures is achieved through detectors and sensors .	119	141

emotions involve different components , such as subjective experience , cognitive processes , expressive behavior , psychophysiological changes , and instrumental behavior . at one time , academics attempted to identify the emotion with one of the components : william james with a subjective experience , behaviorists with instrumental behavior , psychophysiologists with physiological changes , and so on . more recently , emotion is said to consist of all the components . the different components of emotion are categorized somewhat differently depending on the academic discipline . in psychology and philosophy , emotion typically includes a subjective , conscious experience characterized primarily by psychophysiological expressions , biological reactions , and mental states . a similar multicomponential description of emotion is found in sociology . for example , peggy thoits described emotions as involving physiological components , cultural or emotional labels ( e . g . , anger , surprise etc . ) , expressive body actions , and the appraisal of situations and contexts .	125	149

in scherer 's components processing model of emotion , five crucial elements of emotion are said to exist . from the component processing perspective , emotion experience is said to require that all of these processes become coordinated and synchronized for a short period of time , driven by appraisal processes . although the inclusion of cognitive appraisal as one of the elements is slightly controversial , since some theorists make the assumption that emotion and cognition are separate but interacting systems , the component processing model provides a sequence of events that effectively describes the coordination involved during an emotional episode .	19	51

through the use of multidimensional scaling , psychologists can map out similar emotional experiences , which allows a visual depiction of the " emotional distance " between experiences . a further step can be taken by looking at the map 's dimensions of the emotional experiences . the emotional experiences are divided into two dimensions known as valence ( how negative or positive the experience feels ) and arousal ( how energized or enervated the experience feels ) . these two dimensions can be depicted on a 2d coordinate map . this two - dimensional map was theorized to capture one important component of emotion called core affect . core affect is not the only component to emotion , but gives the emotion its hedonic and felt energy .	47	78

tourism has been a key factor in economic development for many southeast asian countries , especially cambodia . according to unesco , " tourism , if correctly conceived , can be a tremendous development tool and an effective means of preserving the cultural diversity of our planet . " since the early 1990s , " even the non - asean nations such as cambodia , laos , vietnam and burma , where the income derived from tourism is low , are attempting to expand their own tourism industries . " in 1995 , singapore was the regional leader in tourism receipts relative to gdp at over 8 % . by 1998 , those receipts had dropped to less than 6 % of gdp while thailand and lao pdr increased receipts to over 7 % . since 2000 , cambodia has surpassed all other asean countries and generated almost 15 % of its gdp from tourism in 2006 .	18	48

spielberg then revisited his close encounters project and , with financial backing from columbia pictures , released close encounters : the special edition in 1980 . for this , spielberg fixed some of the flaws he thought impeded the original 1977 version of the film and also , at the behest of columbia , and as a condition of spielberg revising the film , shot additional footage showing the audience the interior of the mothership seen at the end of the film ( a decision spielberg would later regret as he felt the interior of the mothership should have remained a mystery ) . nevertheless , the re - release was a moderate success , while the 2001 dvd release of the film restored the original ending .	104	127
next , spielberg teamed with star wars creator and friend george lucas on an action adventure film , raiders of the lost ark , the first of the indiana jones films . the archaeologist and adventurer hero indiana jones was played by harrison ford ( whom lucas had previously cast in his star wars films as han solo ) . the film was considered an homage to the cliffhanger serials of the golden age of hollywood . it became the biggest film at the box office in 1981 , and the recipient of numerous oscar nominations including best director ( spielberg 's second nomination ) and best picture ( the second spielberg film to be nominated for best picture ) . raiders is still considered a landmark example of the action - adventure genre . the film also led to ford 's casting in ridley scott 's blade runner .	77	120
his next directorial feature was the raiders prequel indiana jones and the temple of doom . teaming up once again with lucas and ford , the film was plagued with uncertainty for the material and script . this film and the spielberg - produced gremlins led to the creation of the pg - 13 rating due to the high level of violence in films targeted at younger audiences . in spite of this , temple of doom is rated pg by the mpaa , even though it is the darkest and , possibly , most violent indy film . nonetheless , the film was still a huge blockbuster hit in 1984 . it was on this project that spielberg also met his future wife , actress kate capshaw .	99	111

the most persistent theme throughout his films is tension in parent - child relationships . parents ( often fathers ) are reluctant , absent or ignorant . peter banning in hook starts off in the beginning of the film as a reluctant married - to - his - work parent who through the course of the film regains the respect of his children . the notable absence of elliott 's father in e . t . , is the most famous example of this theme . in indiana jones and the last crusade , it is revealed that indy has always had a very strained relationship with his father , who is a professor of medieval literature , as his father always seemed more interested in his work , specifically in his studies of the holy grail , than in his own son , although his father does not seem to realize or understand the negative effect that his aloof nature had on indy ( he even believes he was a good father in the sense that he taught his son " self reliance , " which is not how indy saw it ) . even oskar schindler , from schindler 's list , is reluctant to have a child with his wife . munich depicts avner as a man away from his wife and newborn daughter . there are of course exceptions ; brody in jaws is a committed family man , while john anderton in minority report is a shattered man after the disappearance of his son . this theme is arguably the most autobiographical aspect of spielberg 's films , since spielberg himself was affected by his parents ' divorce as a child and by the absence of his father . furthermore , to this theme , protagonists in his films often come from families with divorced parents , most notably e . t . the extra - terrestrial ( protagonist elliot 's mother is divorced ) and catch me if you can ( frank abagnale 's mother and father split early on in the film ) . little known also is tim in jurassic park ( early in the film , another secondary character mentions tim and lex 's parents ' divorce ) . the family often shown divided is often resolved in the ending as well . following this theme of reluctant fathers and father figures , tim looks to dr . alan grant as a father figure . initially , dr . grant is reluctant to return those paternal feelings to tim . however , by the end of the film , he has changed , and the kids even fall asleep with their heads on his shoulders .	86	194

videoconferencing provides students with the opportunity to learn by participating in two - way communication forums . furthermore , teachers and lecturers worldwide can be brought to remote or otherwise isolated educational facilities . students from diverse communities and backgrounds can come together to learn about one another , although language barriers will continue to persist . such students are able to explore , communicate , analyze and share information and ideas with one another . through videoconferencing , students can visit other parts of the world to speak with their peers , and visit museums and educational facilities . such virtual field trips can provide enriched learning opportunities to students , especially those in geographically isolated locations , and to the economically disadvantaged . small schools can use these technologies to pool resources and provide courses , such as in foreign languages , which could not otherwise be offered .	0	16
in the increasingly globalized film industry , videoconferencing has become useful as a method by which creative talent in many different locations can collaborate closely on the complex details of film production . for example , for the 2013 award - winning animated film frozen , burbank - based walt disney animation studios hired the new york city - based husband - and - wife songwriting team of robert lopez and kristen anderson - lopez to write the songs , which required two - hour - long transcontinental videoconferences nearly every weekday for about 14 months .	33	96

a videoconference system is generally higher cost than a videophone and deploys greater capabilities . a videoconference ( also known as a videoteleconference ) allows two or more locations to communicate via live , simultaneous two - way video and audio transmissions . this is often accomplished by the use of a multipoint control unit ( a centralized distribution and call management system ) or by a similar non - centralized multipoint capability embedded in each videoconferencing unit . again , technology improvements have circumvented traditional definitions by allowing multiple party videoconferencing via web - based applications .	43	78

this technique was very expensive , though , and could not be used for applications such as telemedicine , distance education , and business meetings . attempts at using normal telephony networks to transmit slow - scan video , such as the first systems developed by at & t corporation , first researched in the 1950s , failed mostly due to the poor picture quality and the lack of efficient video compression techniques . the greater 1 mhz bandwidth and 6 mbit / s bit rate of the picturephone in the 1970s also did not achieve commercial success , mostly due to its high cost , but also due to a lack of network effect — with only a few hundred picturephones in the world , users had extremely few contacts they could actually call to , and interoperability with other videophone systems would not exist for decades .	0	25

simultaneous videoconferencing among three or more remote points is possible by means of a multipoint control unit ( mcu ) . this is a bridge that interconnects calls from several sources ( in a similar way to the audio conference call ) . all parties call the mcu , or the mcu can also call the parties which are going to participate , in sequence . there are mcu bridges for ip and isdn - based videoconferencing . there are mcus which are pure software , and others which are a combination of hardware and software . an mcu is characterised according to the number of simultaneous calls it can handle , its ability to conduct transposing of data rates and protocols , and features such as continuous presence , in which multiple parties can be seen on - screen at once . mcus can be stand - alone hardware devices , or they can be embedded into dedicated videoconferencing units .	97	142

the core technology used in a videoconferencing system is digital compression of audio and video streams in real time . the hardware or software that performs compression is called a codec ( coder / decoder ) . compression rates of up to 1 : 500 can be achieved . the resulting digital stream of 1s and 0s is subdivided into labeled packets , which are then transmitted through a digital network of some kind ( usually isdn or ip ) . the use of audio modems in the transmission line allow for the use of pots , or the plain old telephone system , in some low - speed applications , such as videotelephony , because they convert the digital pulses to / from analog waves in the audio spectrum range .	20	36
videoconferencing is a highly useful technology for real - time telemedicine and telenursing applications , such as diagnosis , consulting , transmission of medical images , etc . . . with videoconferencing , patients may contact nurses and physicians in emergency or routine situations ; physicians and other paramedical professionals can discuss cases across large distances . rural areas can use this technology for diagnostic purposes , thus saving lives and making more efficient use of health care money . for example , a rural medical center in ohio , united states , used videoconferencing to successfully cut the number of transfers of sick infants to a hospital 70 miles ( 110 km ) away . this had previously cost nearly $ 10 , 000 per transfer .	80	115

some systems are capable of multipoint conferencing with no mcu , stand - alone , embedded or otherwise . these use a standards - based h . 323 technique known as " decentralized multipoint " , where each station in a multipoint call exchanges video and audio directly with the other stations with no central " manager " or other bottleneck . the advantages of this technique are that the video and audio will generally be of higher quality because they do n't have to be relayed through a central point . also , users can make ad - hoc multipoint calls without any concern for the availability or control of an mcu . this added convenience and quality comes at the expense of some increased network bandwidth , because every station must transmit to every other station directly .	19	61

notably , a statute does not disappear automatically merely because it has been found unconstitutional ; it must be deleted by a subsequent statute . many federal and state statutes have remained on the books for decades after they were ruled to be unconstitutional . however , under the principle of stare decisis , no sensible lower court will enforce an unconstitutional statute , and any court that does so will be reversed by the supreme court . conversely , any court that refuses to enforce a constitutional statute ( where such constitutionality has been expressly established in prior cases ) will risk reversal by the supreme court .	45	77

federal law originates with the constitution , which gives congress the power to enact statutes for certain limited purposes like regulating interstate commerce . the united states code is the official compilation and codification of the general and permanent federal statutes . many statutes give executive branch agencies the power to create regulations , which are published in the federal register and codified into the code of federal regulations . regulations generally also carry the force of law under the chevron doctrine . many lawsuits turn on the meaning of a federal statute or regulation , and judicial interpretations of such meaning carry legal force under the principle of stare decisis .	42	69
after the president signs a bill into law ( or congress enacts it over his veto ) , it is delivered to the office of the federal register ( ofr ) of the national archives and records administration ( nara ) where it is assigned a law number , and prepared for publication as a slip law . public laws , but not private laws , are also given legal statutory citation by the ofr . at the end of each session of congress , the slip laws are compiled into bound volumes called the united states statutes at large , and they are known as session laws . the statutes at large present a chronological arrangement of the laws in the exact order that they have been enacted .	0	57
congress often enacts statutes that grant broad rulemaking authority to federal agencies . often , congress is simply too gridlocked to draft detailed statutes that explain how the agency should react to every possible situation , or congress believes the agency 's technical specialists are best equipped to deal with particular fact situations as they arise . therefore , federal agencies are authorized to promulgate regulations . under the principle of chevron deference , regulations normally carry the force of law as long as they are based on a reasonable interpretation of the relevant statutes .	67	95

the difficult question is whether federal judicial power extends to formulating binding precedent through strict adherence to the rule of stare decisis . this is where the act of deciding a case becomes a limited form of lawmaking in itself , in that an appellate court 's rulings will thereby bind itself and lower courts in future cases ( and therefore also impliedly binds all persons within the court 's jurisdiction ) . prior to a major change to federal court rules in 2007 , about one - fifth of federal appellate cases were published and thereby became binding precedents , while the rest were unpublished and bound only the parties to each case .	0	22
unlike the situation with the states , there is no plenary reception statute at the federal level that continued the common law and thereby granted federal courts the power to formulate legal precedent like their english predecessors . federal courts are solely creatures of the federal constitution and the federal judiciary acts . however , it is universally accepted that the founding fathers of the united states , by vesting " judicial power " into the supreme court and the inferior federal courts in article three of the united states constitution , thereby vested in them the implied judicial power of common law courts to formulate persuasive precedent ; this power was widely accepted , understood , and recognized by the founding fathers at the time the constitution was ratified . several legal scholars have argued that the federal judicial power to decide " cases or controversies " necessarily includes the power to decide the precedential effect of those cases and controversies .	53	130
under the doctrine of erie railroad co . v . tompkins ( 1938 ) , there is no general federal common law . although federal courts can create federal common law in the form of case law , such law must be linked one way or another to the interpretation of a particular federal constitutional provision , statute , or regulation ( which in turn was enacted as part of the constitution or after ) . federal courts lack the plenary power possessed by state courts to simply make up law , which the latter are able to do in the absence of constitutional or statutory provisions replacing the common law . only in a few narrow limited areas , like maritime law , has the constitution expressly authorized the continuation of english common law at the federal level ( meaning that in those areas federal courts can continue to make law as they see fit , subject to the limitations of stare decisis ) .	0	22
most cases are litigated in state courts and involve claims and defenses under state laws . in a 2012 report , the national center for state courts ' court statistics project found that state trial courts received 103 . 5 million newly filed cases in 2010 , which consisted of 56 . 3 million traffic cases , 20 . 4 million criminal cases , 19 . 0 million civil cases , 5 . 9 million domestic relations cases , and 1 . 9 million juvenile cases . in 2010 , state appellate courts received 272 , 795 new cases . by way of comparison , all federal district courts in 2010 together received only about 282 , 000 new civil cases , 77 , 000 new criminal cases , and 1 . 5 million bankruptcy cases , while federal appellate courts received 56 , 000 new cases .	16	86
new york , illinois , and california are the most significant states that have not adopted the frcp . furthermore , all three states continue to maintain most of their civil procedure laws in the form of codified statutes enacted by the state legislature , as opposed to court rules promulgated by the state supreme court , on the ground that the latter are undemocratic . but certain key portions of their civil procedure laws have been modified by their legislatures to bring them closer to federal civil procedure .	19	65
generally , american civil procedure has several notable features , including extensive pretrial discovery , heavy reliance on live testimony obtained at deposition or elicited in front of a jury , and aggressive pretrial " law and motion " practice designed to result in a pretrial disposition ( that is , summary judgment ) or a settlement . u . s . courts pioneered the concept of the opt - out class action , by which the burden falls on class members to notify the court that they do not wish to be bound by the judgment , as opposed to opt - in class actions , where class members must join into the class . another unique feature is the so - called american rule under which parties generally bear their own attorneys ' fees ( as opposed to the english rule of " loser pays " ) , though american legislators and courts have carved out numerous exceptions .	0	57
criminal law involves the prosecution by the state of wrongful acts which are considered to be so serious that they are a breach of the sovereign 's peace ( and can not be deterred or remedied by mere lawsuits between private parties ) . generally , crimes can result in incarceration , but torts ( see below ) can not . the majority of the crimes committed in the united states are prosecuted and punished at the state level . federal criminal law focuses on areas specifically relevant to the federal government like evading payment of federal income tax , mail theft , or physical attacks on federal officials , as well as interstate crimes like drug trafficking and wire fraud .	61	79
some states distinguish between two levels : felonies and misdemeanors ( minor crimes ) . generally , most felony convictions result in lengthy prison sentences as well as subsequent probation , large fines , and orders to pay restitution directly to victims ; while misdemeanors may lead to a year or less in jail and a substantial fine . to simplify the prosecution of traffic violations and other relatively minor crimes , some states have added a third level , infractions . these may result in fines and sometimes the loss of one 's driver 's license , but no jail time .	0	14

contract law covers obligations established by agreement ( express or implied ) between private parties . generally , contract law in transactions involving the sale of goods has become highly standardized nationwide as a result of the widespread adoption of the uniform commercial code . however , there is still significant diversity in the interpretation of other kinds of contracts , depending upon the extent to which a given state has codified its common law of contracts or adopted portions of the restatement ( second ) of contracts .	0	15

philosophical empiricists hold no knowledge to be properly inferred or deduced unless it is derived from one 's sense - based experience . this view is commonly contrasted with rationalism , which states that knowledge may be derived from reason independently of the senses . for example , john locke held that some knowledge ( e . g . knowledge of god 's existence ) could be arrived at through intuition and reasoning alone . similarly robert boyle , a prominent advocate of the experimental method , held that we have innate ideas . the main continental rationalists ( descartes , spinoza , and leibniz ) were also advocates of the empirical " scientific method " .	45	74

aristotle 's explanation of how this was possible was not strictly empiricist in a modern sense , but rather based on his theory of potentiality and actuality , and experience of sense perceptions still requires the help of the active nous . these notions contrasted with platonic notions of the human mind as an entity that pre - existed somewhere in the heavens , before being sent down to join a body on earth ( see plato 's phaedo and apology , as well as others ) . aristotle was considered to give a more important position to sense perception than plato , and commentators in the middle ages summarized one of his positions as " nihil in intellectu nisi prius fuerit in sensu " ( latin for " nothing in the intellect without first being in the senses " ) .	88	141
this idea was later developed in ancient philosophy by the stoic school . stoic epistemology generally emphasized that the mind starts blank , but acquires knowledge as the outside world is impressed upon it . the doxographer aetius summarizes this view as " when a man is born , the stoics say , he has the commanding part of his soul like a sheet of paper ready for writing upon . " later stoics , such as sextus of chaeronea , would continue this idea of empiricism in later stoic writings as well . as sextus contends " for every thought comes from sense - perception or not without sense - perception and either from direct experience or not without direct experience " ( against the professors , 8 . 56 - 8 ) .	72	93

during the middle ages aristotle 's theory of tabula rasa was developed by islamic philosophers starting with al farabi , developing into an elaborate theory by avicenna and demonstrated as a thought experiment by ibn tufail . for avicenna ( ibn sina ) , for example , the tabula rasa is a pure potentiality that is actualized through education , and knowledge is attained through " empirical familiarity with objects in this world from which one abstracts universal concepts " developed through a " syllogistic method of reasoning in which observations lead to propositional statements which when compounded lead to further abstract concepts " . the intellect itself develops from a material intellect ( al - 'aql al - hayulani ) , which is a potentiality " that can acquire knowledge to the active intellect ( al - 'aql al - fa'il ) , the state of the human intellect in conjunction with the perfect source of knowledge " . so the immaterial " active intellect " , separate from any individual person , is still essential for understanding to occur .	4	36

in the 12th century ce the andalusian muslim philosopher and novelist abu bakr ibn tufail ( known as " abubacer " or " ebn tophail " in the west ) included the theory of tabula rasa as a thought experiment in his arabic philosophical novel , hayy ibn yaqdhan in which he depicted the development of the mind of a feral child " from a tabula rasa to that of an adult , in complete isolation from society " on a desert island , through experience alone . the latin translation of his philosophical novel , entitled philosophus autodidactus , published by edward pococke the younger in 1671 , had an influence on john locke 's formulation of tabula rasa in an essay concerning human understanding .	0	87

in the late renaissance various writers began to question the medieval and classical understanding of knowledge acquisition in a more fundamental way . in political and historical writing niccolo machiavelli and his friend francesco guicciardini initiated a new realistic style of writing . machiavelli in particular was scornful of writers on politics who judged everything in comparison to mental ideals and demanded that people should study the " effectual truth " instead . their contemporary , leonardo da vinci ( 1452 – 1519 ) said , " if you find from your own experience that something is a fact and it contradicts what some authority has written down , then you must abandon the authority and base your reasoning on your own findings .

the decidedly anti - aristotelian and anti - clerical music theorist vincenzo galilei ( ca . 1520 – 1591 ) , father of galileo and the inventor of monody , made use of the method in successfully solving musical problems , firstly , of tuning such as the relationship of pitch to string tension and mass in stringed instruments , and to volume of air in wind instruments ; and secondly to composition , by his various suggestions to composers in his dialogo della musica antica e moderna ( florence , 1581 ) . the italian word he used for " experiment " was esperienza . it is known that he was the essential pedagogical influence upon the young galileo , his eldest son ( cf . coelho , ed . music and science in the age of galileo galilei ) , arguably one of the most influential empiricists in history . vincenzo , through his tuning research , found the underlying truth at the heart of the misunderstood myth of ' pythagoras ' hammers ' ( the square of the numbers concerned yielded those musical intervals , not the actual numbers , as believed ) , and through this and other discoveries that demonstrated the fallibility of traditional authorities , a radically empirical attitude developed , passed on to galileo , which regarded " experience and demonstration " as the sine qua non of valid rational enquiry .	16	93
a generation later , the irish anglican bishop , george berkeley ( 1685 – 1753 ) , determined that locke 's view immediately opened a door that would lead to eventual atheism . in response to locke , he put forth in his treatise concerning the principles of human knowledge ( 1710 ) an important challenge to empiricism in which things only exist either as a result of their being perceived , or by virtue of the fact that they are an entity doing the perceiving . ( for berkeley , god fills in for humans by doing the perceiving whenever humans are not around to do it . ) in his text alciphron , berkeley maintained that any order humans may see in nature is the language or handwriting of god . berkeley 's approach to empiricism would later come to be called subjective idealism .	33	86

the scottish philosopher david hume ( 1711 – 1776 ) responded to berkeley 's criticisms of locke , as well as other differences between early modern philosophers , and moved empiricism to a new level of skepticism . hume argued in keeping with the empiricist view that all knowledge derives from sense experience , but he accepted that this has implications not normally acceptable to philosophers . he wrote for example , " locke divides all arguments into demonstrative and probable . on this view , we must say that it is only probable that all men must die or that the sun will rise to - morrow , because neither of these can be demonstrated . but to conform our language more to common use , we ought to divide arguments into demonstrations , proofs , and probabilities — by ‘ proofs ’ meaning arguments from experience that leave no room for doubt or opposition .

hume divided all of human knowledge into two categories : relations of ideas and matters of fact ( see also kant 's analytic - synthetic distinction ) . mathematical and logical propositions ( e . g . " that the square of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the two sides " ) are examples of the first , while propositions involving some contingent observation of the world ( e . g . " the sun rises in the east " ) are examples of the second . all of people 's " ideas " , in turn , are derived from their " impressions " . for hume , an " impression " corresponds roughly with what we call a sensation . to remember or to imagine such impressions is to have an " idea " . ideas are therefore the faint copies of sensations .	0	27
mill 's empiricism thus held that knowledge of any kind is not from direct experience but an inductive inference from direct experience . the problems other philosophers have had with mill 's position center around the following issues : firstly , mill 's formulation encounters difficulty when it describes what direct experience is by differentiating only between actual and possible sensations . this misses some key discussion concerning conditions under which such " groups of permanent possibilities of sensation " might exist in the first place . berkeley put god in that gap ; the phenomenalists , including mill , essentially left the question unanswered . in the end , lacking an acknowledgement of an aspect of " reality " that goes beyond mere " possibilities of sensation " , such a position leads to a version of subjective idealism . questions of how floor beams continue to support a floor while unobserved , how trees continue to grow while unobserved and untouched by human hands , etc . , remain unanswered , and perhaps unanswerable in these terms . secondly , mill 's formulation leaves open the unsettling possibility that the " gap - filling entities are purely possibilities and not actualities at all " . thirdly , mill 's position , by calling mathematics merely another species of inductive inference , misapprehends mathematics . it fails to fully consider the structure and method of mathematical science , the products of which are arrived at through an internally consistent deductive set of procedures which do not , either today or at the time mill wrote , fall under the agreed meaning of induction .	87	105
logical empiricism ( also logical positivism or neopositivism ) was an early 20th - century attempt to synthesize the essential ideas of british empiricism ( e . g . a strong emphasis on sensory experience as the basis for knowledge ) with certain insights from mathematical logic that had been developed by gottlob frege and ludwig wittgenstein . some of the key figures in this movement were otto neurath , moritz schlick and the rest of the vienna circle , along with a . j . ayer , rudolf carnap and hans reichenbach .	0	57
the neopositivists subscribed to a notion of philosophy as the conceptual clarification of the methods , insights and discoveries of the sciences . they saw in the logical symbolism elaborated by frege ( 1848 – 1925 ) and bertrand russell ( 1872 – 1970 ) a powerful instrument that could rationally reconstruct all scientific discourse into an ideal , logically perfect , language that would be free of the ambiguities and deformations of natural language . this gave rise to what they saw as metaphysical pseudoproblems and other conceptual confusions . by combining frege 's thesis that all mathematical truths are logical with the early wittgenstein 's idea that all logical truths are mere linguistic tautologies , they arrived at a twofold classification of all propositions : the analytic ( a priori ) and the synthetic ( a posteriori ) . on this basis , they formulated a strong principle of demarcation between sentences that have sense and those that do not : the so - called verification principle . any sentence that is not purely logical , or is unverifiable is devoid of meaning . as a result , most metaphysical , ethical , aesthetic and other traditional philosophical problems came to be considered pseudoproblems .	23	75
charles peirce ( 1839 – 1914 ) was highly influential in laying the groundwork for today 's empirical scientific method . [ citation needed ] although peirce severely criticized many elements of descartes ' peculiar brand of rationalism , he did not reject rationalism outright . indeed , he concurred with the main ideas of rationalism , most importantly the idea that rational concepts can be meaningful and the idea that rational concepts necessarily go beyond the data given by empirical observation . in later years he even emphasized the concept - driven side of the then ongoing debate between strict empiricism and strict rationalism , in part to counterbalance the excesses to which some of his cohorts had taken pragmatism under the " data - driven " strict - empiricist view .	0	24

in his harvard " lectures on pragmatism " ( 1903 ) , peirce enumerated what he called the " three cotary propositions of pragmatism " ( l : cos , cotis whetstone ) , saying that they " put the edge on the maxim of pragmatism " . first among these he listed the peripatetic - thomist observation mentioned above , but he further observed that this link between sensory perception and intellectual conception is a two - way street . that is , it can be taken to say that whatever we find in the intellect is also incipiently in the senses . hence , if theories are theory - laden then so are the senses , and perception itself can be seen as a species of abductive inference , its difference being that it is beyond control and hence beyond critique – in a word , incorrigible . this in no way conflicts with the fallibility and revisability of scientific concepts , since it is only the immediate percept in its unique individuality or " thisness " – what the scholastics called its haecceity – that stands beyond control and correction . scientific concepts , on the other hand , are general in nature , and transient sensations do in another sense find correction within them . this notion of perception as abduction has received periodic revivals in artificial intelligence and cognitive science research , most recently for instance with the work of irvin rock on indirect perception .	0	47

john dewey ( 1859 – 1952 ) modified james ' pragmatism to form a theory known as instrumentalism . the role of sense experience in dewey 's theory is crucial , in that he saw experience as unified totality of things through which everything else is interrelated . dewey 's basic thought , in accordance with empiricism was that reality is determined by past experience . therefore , humans adapt their past experiences of things to perform experiments upon and test the pragmatic values of such experience . the value of such experience is measured experientially and scientifically , and the results of such tests generate ideas that serve as instruments for future experimentation , in physical sciences as in ethics . thus , ideas in dewey 's system retain their empiricist flavour in that they are only known a posteriori .	48	65

" [ page needed ] according to carr , the " bastion " created by means of the pact , " was and could only be , a line of defense against potential german attack .

" [ page needed ] however , during the last decades , this view has been disputed . historian werner maser stated that " the claim that the soviet union was at the time threatened by hitler , as stalin supposed . . . is a legend , to whose creators stalin himself belonged . in maser 's view , " neither germany nor japan were in a situation [ of ] invading the ussr even with the least perspective [ sic ] of success , " and this could not have been unknown to stalin . carr further stated that , for a long time , the primary motive of stalin 's sudden change of course was assumed to be the fear of german aggressive intentions .	74	105

nonverbal communication describes the process of conveying meaning in the form of non - word messages . examples of nonverbal communication include haptic communication , chronemic communication , gestures , body language , facial expression , eye contact , and how one dresses . nonverbal communication also relates to intent of a message . examples of intent are voluntary , intentional movements like shaking a hand or winking , as well as involuntary , such as sweating . speech also contains nonverbal elements known as paralanguage , e . g . rhythm , intonation , tempo , and stress . there may even be a pheromone component . research has shown that up to 55 % of human communication may occur through non - verbal facial expressions , and a further 38 % through paralanguage . it affects communication most at the subconscious level and establishes trust . likewise , written texts include nonverbal elements such as handwriting style , spatial arrangement of words and the use of emoticons to convey emotion .	0	16

fungi communicate to coordinate and organize their growth and development such as the formation of marcelia and fruiting bodies . fungi communicate with their own and related species as well as with non fungal organisms in a great variety of symbiotic interactions , especially with bacteria , unicellular eukaryote , plants and insects through biochemicals of biotic origin . the biochemicals trigger the fungal organism to react in a specific manner , while if the same chemical molecules are not part of biotic messages , they do not trigger the fungal organism to react . this implies that fungal organisms can differentiate between molecules taking part in biotic messages and similar molecules being irrelevant in the situation . so far five different primary signalling molecules are known to coordinate different behavioral patterns such as filamentation , mating , growth , and pathogenicity . behavioral coordination and production of signaling substances is achieved through interpretation processes that enables the organism to differ between self or non - self , a biotic indicator , biotic message from similar , related , or non - related species , and even filter out " noise " , i . e . similar molecules without biotic content .	118	142

communication is usually described along a few major dimensions : message ( what type of things are communicated ) , source / emisor / sender / encoder ( by whom ) , form ( in which form ) , channel ( through which medium ) , destination / receiver / target / decoder ( to whom ) , and receiver . wilbur schram ( 1954 ) also indicated that we should also examine the impact that a message has ( both desired and undesired ) on the target of the message . between parties , communication includes acts that confer knowledge and experiences , give advice and commands , and ask questions . these acts may take many forms , in one of the various manners of communication . the form depends on the abilities of the group communicating . together , communication content and form make messages that are sent towards a destination . the target can be oneself , another person or being , another entity ( such as a corporation or group of beings ) .	61	91
effective verbal or spoken communication is dependent on a number of factors and can not be fully isolated from other important interpersonal skills such as non - verbal communication , listening skills and clarification . human language can be defined as a system of symbols ( sometimes known as lexemes ) and the grammars ( rules ) by which the symbols are manipulated . the word " language " also refers to common properties of languages . language learning normally occurs most intensively during human childhood . most of the thousands of human languages use patterns of sound or gesture for symbols which enable communication with others around them . languages tend to share certain properties , although there are exceptions . there is no defined line between a language and a dialect . constructed languages such as esperanto , programming languages , and various mathematical formalism is not necessarily restricted to the properties shared by human languages . communication is two - way process not merely one - way .	134	158
the broad field of animal communication encompasses most of the issues in ethology . animal communication can be defined as any behavior of one animal that affects the current or future behavior of another animal . the study of animal communication , called zoo semiotics ( distinguishable from anthroposemiotics , the study of human communication ) has played an important part in the development of ethology , sociobiology , and the study of animal cognition . animal communication , and indeed the understanding of the animal world in general , is a rapidly growing field , and even in the 21st century so far , a great share of prior understanding related to diverse fields such as personal symbolic name use , animal emotions , animal culture and learning , and even sexual conduct , long thought to be well understood , has been revolutionized . a special field of animal communication has been investigated in more detail such as vibrational communication .	146	162
in a simple model , often referred to as the transmission model or standard view of communication , information or content ( e . g . a message in natural language ) is sent in some form ( as spoken language ) from an emisor / sender / encoder to a destination / receiver / decoder . this common conception of communication simply views communication as a means of sending and receiving information . the strengths of this model are simplicity , generality , and quantifiability . claude shannon and warren weaver structured this model based on the following elements :	74	86
communication is observed within the plant organism , i . e . within plant cells and between plant cells , between plants of the same or related species , and between plants and non - plant organisms , especially in the root zone . plant roots communicate with rhizome bacteria , fungi , and insects within the soil . these interactions are governed by syntactic , pragmatic , and semantic rules , [ citation needed ] and are possible because of the decentralized " nervous system " of plants . the original meaning of the word " neuron " in greek is " vegetable fiber " and recent research has shown that most of the microorganism plant communication processes are neuron - like . plants also communicate via volatiles when exposed to herbivory attack behavior , thus warning neighboring plants . in parallel they produce other volatiles to attract parasites which attack these herbivores . in stress situations plants can overwrite the genomes they inherited from their parents and revert to that of their grand - or great - grandparents .

theories of coregulation describe communication as a creative and dynamic continuous process , rather than a discrete exchange of information . canadian media scholar harold innis had the theory that people use different types of media to communicate and which one they choose to use will offer different possibilities for the shape and durability of society ( wark , mckenzie 1997 ) . his famous example of this is using ancient egypt and looking at the ways they built themselves out of media with very different properties stone and papyrus . papyrus is what he called ' space binding ' . it made possible the transmission of written orders across space , empires and enables the waging of distant military campaigns and colonial administration . the other is stone and ' time binding ' , through the construction of temples and the pyramids can sustain their authority generation to generation , through this media they can change and shape communication in their society ( wark , mckenzie 1997 ) .	21	62

companies with limited resources may choose to engage in only a few of these activities , while larger organizations may employ a full spectrum of communications . since it is difficult to develop such a broad range of skills , communications professionals often specialize in one or two of these areas but usually have at least a working knowledge of most of them . by far , the most important qualifications communications professionals can possess are excellent writing ability , good ' people ' skills , and the capacity to think critically and strategically .	64	94

unlike all other british government records , the records from the east india company ( and its successor the india office ) are not in the national archives at kew , london , but are held by the british library in london as part of the asia , pacific and africa collections . the catalogue is searchable online in the access to archives catalogues . many of the east india company records are freely available online under an agreement that the families in british india society has with the british library . published catalogues exist of east india company ships ' journals and logs , 1600 – 1834 ; and of some of the company 's daughter institutions , including the east india company college , haileybury , and addiscombe military seminary .	0	52
combining statements in the canonical gospels produces the following account : jesus was arrested in gethsemane following the last supper with the twelve apostles , and then stood trial before the sanhedrin ( a jewish judicial body ) , pontius pilate ( a roman authority in judaea ) , and herod antipas ( king of judea , appointed by rome ) , before being handed over for crucifixion by the chief priests of the jews . after being flogged , jesus was mocked by roman soldiers as the " king of the jews " , clothed in a purple robe , crowned with thorns , beaten and spat on . jesus then had to make his way to the place of his crucifixion .	76	109
once at golgotha , jesus was offered wine mixed with gall to drink . matthew 's and mark 's gospels record that he refused this . he was then crucified and hung between two convicted thieves . according to some translations from the original greek , the thieves may have been bandits or jewish rebels . according to mark 's gospel , he endured the torment of crucifixion for some six hours from the third hour , at approximately 9 am , until his death at the ninth hour , corresponding to about 3 pm . the soldiers affixed a sign above his head stating " jesus of nazareth , king of the jews " in three languages , divided his garments and cast lots for his seamless robe . the roman soldiers did not break jesus ' legs , as they did to the other two men crucified ( breaking the legs hastened the crucifixion process ) , as jesus was dead already . each gospel has its own account of jesus ' last words , seven statements altogether . in the synoptic gospels , various supernatural events accompany the crucifixion , including darkness , an earthquake , and ( in matthew ) the resurrection of saints . following jesus ' death , his body was removed from the cross by joseph of arimathea and buried in a rock - hewn tomb , with nicodemus assisting .	0	13
according to the first epistle to the corinthians ( 1 cor . 15 : 4 ) , jesus was raised from the dead ( " on the third day " counting the day of crucifixion as the first ) and according to the canonical gospels , appeared to his disciples on different occasions before ascending to heaven . the account given in acts of the apostles , which says jesus remained with the apostles for forty days , appears to differ from the account in the gospel of luke , which makes no clear distinction between the events of easter sunday and the ascension . however , most biblical scholars agree that st . luke also wrote the acts of the apostles as a follow - up volume to his gospel account , and the two works must be considered as a whole .	58	104
in mark , jesus is crucified along with two rebels , and the day goes dark for three hours . jesus calls out to god , then gives a shout and dies . the curtain of the temple is torn in two . matthew follows mark , adding an earthquake and the resurrection of saints . luke also follows mark , though he describes the rebels as common criminals , one of whom defends jesus , who in turn promises that he ( jesus ) and the criminal will be together in paradise . luke portrays jesus as impassive in the face of his crucifixion . john includes several of the same elements as those found in mark , though they are treated differently .	94	105
an early non - christian reference to the crucifixion of jesus is likely to be mara bar - serapion 's letter to his son , written sometime after ad 73 but before the 3rd century ad . the letter includes no christian themes and the author is presumed to be a pagan . the letter refers to the retributions that followed the unjust treatment of three wise men : socrates , pythagoras , and " the wise king " of the jews . some scholars see little doubt that the reference to the execution of the " king of the jews " is about the crucifixion of jesus , while others place less value in the letter , given the possible ambiguity in the reference .	37	52
the consensus of modern scholarship is that the new testament accounts represent a crucifixion occurring on a friday , but a thursday or wednesday crucifixion have also been proposed . some scholars explain a thursday crucifixion based on a " double sabbath " caused by an extra passover sabbath falling on thursday dusk to friday afternoon , ahead of the normal weekly sabbath . some have argued that jesus was crucified on wednesday , not friday , on the grounds of the mention of " three days and three nights " in matthew before his resurrection , celebrated on sunday . others have countered by saying that this ignores the jewish idiom by which a " day and night " may refer to any part of a 24 - hour period , that the expression in matthew is idiomatic , not a statement that jesus was 72 hours in the tomb , and that the many references to a resurrection on the third day do not require three literal nights .	0	29
the placing of the nails in the hands , or the wrists is also uncertain . some theories suggest that the greek word cheir ( χειρ ) for hand includes the wrist and that the romans were generally trained to place nails through destot 's space ( between the capitate and lunate bones ) without fracturing any bones . another theory suggests that the greek word for hand also includes the forearm and that the nails were placed near the radius and ulna of the forearm . ropes may have also been used to fasten the hands in addition to the use of nails .	87	104
some christian writers considered the possibility that pagan commentators may have mentioned this event , mistaking it for a solar eclipse - although this would have been impossible during the passover , which takes place at the full moon . christian traveller and historian sextus julius africanus and christian theologian origen refer to greek historian phlegon , who lived in the 2nd century ad , as having written " with regard to the eclipse in the time of tiberius caesar , in whose reign jesus appears to have been crucified , and the great earthquakes which then took place "	0	39

sextus julius africanus further refers to the writings of historian thallus : " this darkness thallus , in the third book of his history , calls , as appears to me without reason , an eclipse of the sun . for the hebrews celebrate the passover on the 14th day according to the moon , and the passion of our saviour falls on the day before the passover ; but an eclipse of the sun takes place only when the moon comes under the sun .

colin humphreys and w . g . waddington of oxford university considered the possibility that a lunar , rather than solar , eclipse might have taken place . they concluded that such an eclipse would have been visible , for thirty minutes , from jerusalem and suggested the gospel reference to a solar eclipse was the result of a scribe wrongly amending a text . historian david henige dismisses this explanation as ' indefensible ' and astronomer bradley schaefer points out that the lunar eclipse would not have been visible during daylight hours .	28	64

modern biblical scholarship treats the account in the synoptic gospels as a literary creation by the author of the mark gospel , amended in the luke and matthew accounts , intended to heighten the importance of what they saw as a theologically significant event , and not intended to be taken literally . this image of darkness over the land would have been understood by ancient readers , a typical element in the description of the death of kings and other major figures by writers such as philo , dio cassius , virgil , plutarch and josephus . geza vermes describes the darkness account as typical of " jewish eschatological imagery of the day of the lord " , and says that those interpreting it as a datable eclipse are " barking up the wrong tree " .	98	137
in his book the crucifixion of jesus , physician and forensic pathologist frederick zugibe studied the likely circumstances of the death of jesus in great detail . zugibe carried out a number of experiments over several years to test his theories while he was a medical examiner . these studies included experiments in which volunteers with specific weights were hanging at specific angles and the amount of pull on each hand was measured , in cases where the feet were also secured or not . in these cases the amount of pull and the corresponding pain was found to be significant .	0	26
the presence of the virgin mary under the cross [ jn . 19 : 26 - 27 ] has in itself been the subject of marian art , and well known catholic symbolism such as the miraculous medal and pope john paul ii 's coat of arms bearing a marian cross . and a number of marian devotions also involve the presence of the virgin mary in calvary , e . g . , pope john paul ii stated that " mary was united to jesus on the cross " . well known works of christian art by masters such as raphael ( e . g . , the mond crucifixion ) , and caravaggio ( e . g . , his entombment ) depict the virgin mary as part of the crucifixion scene .	91	134
phonology is a branch of linguistics concerned with the systematic organization of sounds in languages . it has traditionally focused largely on the study of the systems of phonemes in particular languages ( and therefore used to be also called phonemics , or phonematics ) , but it may also cover any linguistic analysis either at a level beneath the word ( including syllable , onset and rime , articulatory gestures , articulatory features , mora , etc . ) or at all levels of language where sound is considered to be structured for conveying linguistic meaning . phonology also includes the study of equivalent organizational systems in sign languages .	98	110

phonology is often distinguished from phonetics . while phonetics concerns the physical production , acoustic transmission and perception of the sounds of speech , phonology describes the way sounds function within a given language or across languages to encode meaning . for many linguists , phonetics belongs to descriptive linguistics , and phonology to theoretical linguistics , although establishing the phonological system of a language is necessarily an application of theoretical principles to analysis of phonetic evidence . note that this distinction was not always made , particularly before the development of the modern concept of the phoneme in the mid 20th century . some subfields of modern phonology have a crossover with phonetics in descriptive disciplines such as psycholinguistics and speech perception , resulting in specific areas like articulatory phonology or laboratory phonology .	104	134

in 1968 noam chomsky and morris halle published the sound pattern of english ( spe ) , the basis for generative phonology . in this view , phonological representations are sequences of segments made up of distinctive features . these features were an expansion of earlier work by roman jakobson , gunnar fant , and morris halle . the features describe aspects of articulation and perception , are from a universally fixed set , and have the binary values + or − . there are at least two levels of representation : underlying representation and surface phonetic representation . ordered phonological rules govern how underlying representation is transformed into the actual pronunciation ( the so - called surface form ) . an important consequence of the influence spe had on phonological theory was the downplaying of the syllable and the emphasis on segments . furthermore , the generativists folded morphophonology into phonology , which both solved and created problems .	0	22

natural phonology is a theory based on the publications of its proponent david stampe in 1969 and ( more explicitly ) in 1979 . in this view , phonology is based on a set of universal phonological processes that interact with one another ; which ones are active and which are suppressed is language - specific . rather than acting on segments , phonological processes act on distinctive features within prosodic groups . prosodic groups can be as small as a part of a syllable or as large as an entire utterance . phonological processes are unordered with respect to each other and apply simultaneously ( though the output of one process may be the input to another ) . the second most prominent natural phonologist is patricia donegan ( stampe 's wife ) ; there are many natural phonologists in europe , and a few in the u . s . , such as geoffrey nathan . the principles of natural phonology were extended to morphology by wolfgang u . dressler , who founded natural morphology .	24	56

in 1976 john goldsmith introduced autosegmental phonology . phonological phenomena are no longer seen as operating on one linear sequence of segments , called phonemes or feature combinations , but rather as involving some parallel sequences of features which reside on multiple tiers . autosegmental phonology later evolved into feature geometry , which became the standard theory of representation for theories of the organization of phonology as different as lexical phonology and optimality theory .	0	7

government phonology , which originated in the early 1980s as an attempt to unify theoretical notions of syntactic and phonological structures , is based on the notion that all languages necessarily follow a small set of principles and vary according to their selection of certain binary parameters . that is , all languages ' phonological structures are essentially the same , but there is restricted variation that accounts for differences in surface realizations . principles are held to be inviolable , though parameters may sometimes come into conflict . prominent figures in this field include jonathan kaye , jean lowenstamm , jean - roger vergnaud , monik charette , and john harris .	48	73

in a course at the lsa summer institute in 1991 , alan prince and paul smolensky developed optimality theory — an overall architecture for phonology according to which languages choose a pronunciation of a word that best satisfies a list of constraints ordered by importance ; a lower - ranked constraint can be violated when the violation is necessary in order to obey a higher - ranked constraint . the approach was soon extended to morphology by john mccarthy and alan prince , and has become a dominant trend in phonology . the appeal to phonetic grounding of constraints and representational elements ( e . g . features ) in various approaches has been criticized by proponents of ' substance - free phonology ' , especially mark hale and charles reiss .	0	68

an important part of traditional , pre - generative schools of phonology is studying which sounds can be grouped into distinctive units within a language ; these units are known as phonemes . for example , in english , the " p " sound in pot is aspirated ( pronounced [ pʰ ] ) while that in spot is not aspirated ( pronounced [ p ] ) . however , english speakers intuitively treat both sounds as variations ( allophones ) of the same phonological category , that is of the phoneme / p / . ( traditionally , it would be argued that if an aspirated [ pʰ ] were interchanged with the unaspirated [ p ] in spot , native speakers of english would still hear the same words ; that is , the two sounds are perceived as " the same " / p / . ) in some other languages , however , these two sounds are perceived as different , and they are consequently assigned to different phonemes . for example , in thai , hindi , and quechua , there are minimal pairs of words for which aspiration is the only contrasting feature ( two words can have different meanings but with the only difference in pronunciation being that one has an aspirated sound where the other has an unaspirated one ) .	68	95

part of the phonological study of a language therefore involves looking at data ( phonetic transcriptions of the speech of native speakers ) and trying to deduce what the underlying phonemes are and what the sound inventory of the language is . the presence or absence of minimal pairs , as mentioned above , is a frequently used criterion for deciding whether two sounds should be assigned to the same phoneme . however , other considerations often need to be taken into account as well .	0	41

the particular contrasts which are phonemic in a language can change over time . at one time , [ f ] and [ v ] , two sounds that have the same place and manner of articulation and differ in voicing only , were allophones of the same phoneme in english , but later came to belong to separate phonemes . this is one of the main factors of historical change of languages as described in historical linguistics .	14	60

the findings and insights of speech perception and articulation research complicate the traditional and somewhat intuitive idea of interchangeable allophones being perceived as the same phoneme . first , interchanged allophones of the same phoneme can result in unrecognizable words . second , actual speech , even at a word level , is highly co - articulated , so it is problematic to expect to be able to splice words into simple segments without affecting speech perception .	27	40

different linguists therefore take different approaches to the problem of assigning sounds to phonemes . for example , they differ in the extent to which they require allophones to be phonetically similar . there are also differing ideas as to whether this grouping of sounds is purely a tool for linguistic analysis , or reflects an actual process in the way the human brain processes a language .	33	67

the creation of modern - day eritrea is a result of the incorporation of independent , distinct kingdoms and sultanates ( for example , medri bahri and the sultanate of aussa ) eventually resulting in the formation of italian eritrea . in 1947 eritrea became part of a federation with ethiopia , the federation of ethiopia and eritrea . subsequent annexation into ethiopia led to the eritrean war of independence , ending with eritrean independence following a referendum in april 1993 . hostilities between eritrea and ethiopia persisted , leading to the eritrean – ethiopian war of 1998 – 2000 and further skirmishes with both djibouti and ethiopia .	41	58
eritrea is a member of the united nations , the african union , and is an observing member of the arab league . the nation holds a seat on the united nations ' advisory committee on administrative and budgetary questions ( acabq ) . eritrea also holds memberships in the international bank for reconstruction and development , international finance corporation , international criminal police organization ( interpol ) , non - aligned movement , organization for the prohibition of chemical weapons , permanent court of arbitration , and the world customs organization .	23	43
the kingdom is mentioned in the periplus of the erythraean sea as an important market place for ivory , which was exported throughout the ancient world . aksum was at the time ruled by zoskales , who also governed the port of adulis . the aksumite rulers facilitated trade by minting their own aksumite currency . the state also established its hegemony over the declining kingdom of kush and regularly entered the politics of the kingdoms on the arabian peninsula , eventually extending its rule over the region with the conquest of the himyarite kingdom .	56	95

following the adoption of un resolution 390a ( v ) in december 1950 , eritrea was federated with ethiopia under the prompting of the united states . the resolution called for eritrea and ethiopia to be linked through a loose federal structure under the sovereignty of the emperor . eritrea was to have its own administrative and judicial structure , its own flag , and control over its domestic affairs , including police , local administration , and taxation . the federal government , which for all intents and purposes was the existing imperial government , was to control foreign affairs ( including commerce ) , defense , finance , and transportation . the resolution ignored the wishes of eritreans for independence , but guaranteed the population democratic rights and a measure of autonomy .	113	134

eritrea can be split into three ecoregions . to the east of the highlands are the hot , arid coastal plains stretching down to the southeast of the country . the cooler , more fertile highlands , reaching up to 3000 m has a different habitat . habitats here vary from the sub - tropical rainforest at filfil solomona to the precipitous cliffs and canyons of the southern highlands . the afar triangle or danakil depression of eritrea is the probable location of a triple junction where three tectonic plates are pulling away from one another . the highest point of the country , emba soira , is located in the center of eritrea , at 3 , 018 meters ( 9 , 902 ft ) above sea level .	95	129
it is estimated that there are around 100 elephants left in eritrea , the most northerly of east africa 's elephants . the endangered african wild dog ( lycaon pictus ) was previously found in eritrea , but is now deemed extirpated from the entire country . in gash barka , deadly snakes like saw - scaled viper are common . puff adder and red spitting cobra are widespread and can be found even in the highlands . in the coastal areas marine species that are common include dolphin , dugong , whale shark , turtles , marlin / swordfish , and manta ray .	0	21
in an attempt at reform , eritrean government officials and ngo representatives have participated in numerous public meetings and dialogues . in these sessions they have answered questions as fundamental as , " what are human rights ? " , " who determines what are human rights ? " , and " what should take precedence , human or communal rights ? " in 2007 , the eritrean government also banned female genital mutilation . in regional assemblies and religious circles , eritreans themselves speak out continuously against the use of female circumcision . they cite health concerns and individual freedom as being of primary concern when they say this . furthermore , they implore rural peoples to cast away this ancient cultural practice . additionally , a new movement called citizens for democratic rights in eritrea aimed at bringing about dialogue between the government and opposition was formed in early 2009 . the group consists of ordinary citizens and some people close to the government .	63	74
even during the war , eritrea developed its transportation infrastructure by asphalting new roads , improving its ports , and repairing war - damaged roads and bridges as a part of the warsay yika'alo program . the most significant of these projects was the construction of a coastal highway of more than 500 km connecting massawa with asseb , as well as the rehabilitation of the eritrean railway . the rail line has been restored between the port of massawa and the capital asmara , although services are sporadic . steam locomotives are sometimes used for groups of enthusiasts .	90	99

when steve jobs returned to apple in 1997 following the company 's purchase of next , he ordered that the os that had been previewed as version 7 . 7 be branded mac os 8 ( in place of the never - to - appear copland os ) . since apple had licensed only system 7 to third parties , this move effectively ended the clone line . the decision caused significant financial losses for companies like motorola , who produced the starmax ; umax , who produced the supermac ; and power computing , who offered several lines of mac clones , including the powerwave , powertower , and powertower pro . these companies had invested substantial resources in creating their own mac - compatible hardware . apple bought out power computing 's license , but allowed umax to continue selling mac clones until their license expired , as they had a sizeable presence in the lower - end segment that apple did not . in september 1997 apple extended umax ' license allowing them to sell clones with mac os 8 , the only clone maker to do so , but with the restriction that they only sell low - end systems . without the higher profit margins of high - end systems , however , umax judged this would not be profitable and exited the mac clone market in may 1998 , having lost usd $ 36 million on the program .	49	67

in recent years , apple has seen a significant boost in sales of macs . this has been attributed , in part , to the success of the ipod and the iphone , a halo effect whereby satisfied ipod or iphone owners purchase more apple products , and apple has since capitalized on that with the icloud cloud service that allows users to seamlessly sync data between these devices and macs . nonetheless , like other personal computer manufacturers , the macintosh lines have been hurt by consumer trend towards smartphones and tablet computers ( particularly apple 's own iphone and ipad , respectively ) as the computing devices of choice among consumers .	15	71

the macintosh project was begun in 1979 by jef raskin , an apple employee who envisioned an easy - to - use , low - cost computer for the average consumer . he wanted to name the computer after his favorite type of apple , the mcintosh , but the spelling was changed to " macintosh " for legal reasons as the original was the same spelling as that used by mcintosh laboratory , inc . , the audio equipment manufacturer . steve jobs requested that mcintosh laboratory give apple a release for the name with its changed spelling so that apple could use it , but the request was denied , forcing apple to eventually buy the rights to use the name . ( a 1984 byte magazine article suggested apple changed the spelling only after " early users " misspelled " mcintosh " . however , jef raskin had adopted the macintosh spelling by 1981 , when the macintosh computer was still a single prototype machine in the lab . this explanation further clashes with the first explanation given above that the change was made for " legal reasons .

by march 2011 , the market share of os x in north america had increased to slightly over 14 % . whether the size of the mac 's market share and installed base is relevant , and to whom , is a hotly debated issue . industry pundits have often called attention to the mac 's relatively small market share to predict apple 's impending doom , particularly in the early and mid - 1990s when the company 's future seemed bleakest . others argue that market share is the wrong way to judge the mac 's success . apple has positioned the mac as a higher - end personal computer , and so it may be misleading to compare it to a budget pc . because the overall market for personal computers has grown rapidly , the mac 's increasing sales numbers are effectively swamped by the industry 's expanding sales volume as a whole . apple 's small market share , then , gives the impression that fewer people are using macs than did ten years ago , when exactly the opposite is true . soaring sales of the iphone and ipad mean that the portion of apple 's profits represented by the macintosh has declined in 2010 , dropping to 24 % from 46 % two years earlier . others try to de - emphasize market share , citing that it is rarely brought up in other industries . regardless of the mac 's market share , apple has remained profitable since steve jobs ' return and the company 's subsequent reorganization . notably , a report published in the first quarter of 2008 found that apple had a 14 % market share in the personal computer market in the us , including 66 % of all computers over $ 1 , 000 . market research indicates that apple draws its customer base from a higher - income demographic than the mainstream personal computer market .	99	125

the sales breakdown of the macintosh have seen sales of desktop macs stayed mostly constant while being surpassed by that of mac notebooks whose sales rate has grown considerably ; seven out of ten macs sold were laptops in 2009 , a ratio projected to rise to three out of four by 2010 . the change in sales of form factors is due to the desktop imac moving from affordable ( imac g3 ) to upscale ( imac g4 ) and subsequent releases are considered premium all - in - ones . by contrast the msrp of the macbook laptop lines have dropped through successive generations such that the macbook air and macbook pro constitute the lowest price of entry to a mac , with the exception of the even more inexpensive mac mini ( the only sub - $ 1000 offering from apple , albeit without a monitor and keyboard ) , not surprisingly the macbooks are the top - selling form factors of the macintosh platform today . the use of intel microprocessors has helped macs more directly compete with their windows counterparts on price and performance , and by the 2010s apple was receiving intel 's latest cpus first before other pc manufacturers .	92	169

in 1998 , apple introduced its new imac which , like the original 128 k mac , was an all - in - one computer . its translucent plastic case , originally bondi blue and later various additional colors , is considered an industrial design landmark of the late 1990s . the imac did away with most of apple 's standard ( and usually proprietary ) connections , such as scsi and adb , in favor of two usb ports . it replaced a floppy disk drive with a cd - rom drive for installing software , but was incapable of writing to cds or other media without external third - party hardware . the imac proved to be phenomenally successful , with 800 , 000 units sold in 139 days . it made the company an annual profit of us $ 309 million , apple 's first profitable year since michael spindler took over as ceo in 1995 . this aesthetic was applied to the power macintosh and later the ibook , apple 's first consumer - level laptop computer , filling the missing quadrant of apple 's " four - square product matrix " ( desktop and portable products for both consumers and professionals ) . more than 140 , 000 pre - orders were placed before it started shipping in september , and by october proved to be a large success .	51	80

most of the differences in the revised budget deficit numbers were due to a temporary change of accounting practices by the new government , i . e . , recording expenses when military material was ordered rather than received . however , it was the retroactive application of esa95 methodology ( applied since 2000 ) by eurostat , that finally raised the reference year ( 1999 ) budget deficit to 3 . 38 % of gdp , thus exceeding the 3 % limit . this led to claims that greece ( similar claims have been made about other european countries like italy ) had not actually met all five accession criteria , and the common perception that greece entered the eurozone through " falsified " deficit numbers .	84	127
